            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Many, who well knew how mighty this Man of God was in the Scriptures, and how skilful, from his great Abilities, and long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the interpreting of them, have impatiently deſired the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of his Labours; but that being a Work of time, it was thought fit to gratify them in the <hi>interim</hi> with this ſhort Treatiſe. And tho his excellency lay chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:60376:3"/> in wading into the great Deeps of the Goſpel, yet among many other Diſcourſes, this of <hi>Hell</hi> was made choice of, wherein, we think, you have the true ſcriptural Notion of it. We judged that ſuch a rouſing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument might not be unſeaſonable in ſo ſecure and Atheiſtical an Age as this; and that the Profound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, excellently diſcovered in his Lectures upon the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> might be the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com to thoſe who have known the Terrors of the Lord, or have their Senſes exerciſed to diſcern ſpiritual things. Upon the requeſt of ſome, we have alſo added a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>State of Glory for the Saints, immediately after this Life,</hi> being very ſuitable to Times of Suffering; ſince it was the conſtant Method of the Apoſtles, to keep up in the Eyes of the Primitive Saints, the Glory of another World,
<pb facs="tcp:60376:3"/> as what was proper to ſupport them under the Sufferings of this: And 'twas one main deſign of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration of Chriſt, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who were to be great Sufferers in the Times of the New Teſtament, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had been under the Old; intimating what the Saints in after Ages might expect, in a Conformity to Chriſt, after all their Sufferings.</p>
            <p>We therefore judg both Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fitly joined together, <hi>Puniſhments</hi> and <hi>Rewards</hi> being great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which God propoſeth to Obedience, and Perſeverance in Holineſs, and are both neceſſary at this time to be urged: the one, to awaken hardened and ſecure Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the other, to encourage Chriſtians to go on in a holy Courſe, through all the difficulties of this degenerate Age.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60376:4"/>

                        <p n="1">1. You ſee he here brings in the great God, as an enraged Enemy, challenging the execution hereof to himſelf. <hi>This Vengeance belongeth to me,</hi> or, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Let me alone with it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In that when he would ſet out the ſevereneſs of this Puniſhment (which is his profeſſed aim, <hi>ver.</hi> 29.) as infinitely exceeding all thoſe kinds of Corporal deaths in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, he inferreth the ſoreneſs of this <hi>from God himſelf as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger: We [know him] that hath</hi> thus ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine;</hi> that is, what a great and powerful God he is. The Saints only <hi>know God by Faith</hi> in Himſelf, and his Greatneſs, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and that ſo as no other Men in this Life do. And by what we know of him, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions we have of Him, we cannot but forwarn what that Puniſhment muſt needs be, when God himſelf ſhall thus ſolemnly profeſs himſelf to be the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. 'Tis argued you ſee both from what this God is, and from that knowledg the Saints have of Him. They, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone know Him in his Love, and have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60376:10"/> taſted and found that his immediate <hi>Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-kindneſs is better than Life:</hi> and from the Law of Contraries, they know that his Wrath muſt be more bitter than Death. <hi>They are able to meaſure what he is in his Wrath, by what he is in his Love.</hi> And ſome of the Primitive Saints, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Apoſtles, who <hi>had the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> knew and had <hi>taſted how good the Lord is in his Love,</hi> by immediate Impreſſions of it on their Souls, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Himſelf. The like tenour of ſpeech has that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>We knowing the Terror of the Lord:</hi> It is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>[His Terror]</hi> as noting out that which is proper to Him and his Greatneſs, in his being able to puniſh and deſtroy Sinners.</p>

                           <hi>Moſes,</hi> who in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> had ſeen <hi>the Glory of God</hi> the moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of any Man (and was therein a Type of Chriſt) was thereby made ſenſible of this very thing, as touching this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore complains in the very like Language, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>Who knows the Power of thine Anger?</hi> Lamenting how the generality of Men did not know it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed they <hi>knew not God.</hi> But <hi>We</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>have known him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And 3. Thereupon he further calls this Puniſhment, <hi>[a falling into God's</hi>

When a Father or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter threaten a Child, or a young Servant, already corrected by other Hands at their appointment, yet when either would threaten more ſeverely, they'l ſay, <hi>Take heed how you fall into my hands,</hi> or come under my fingers, when they mean to correct them themſelves.</p>
                        <p>And then 4. That the Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, infers from this the dreadfulneſs thereof, even from this, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of God.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tells us that the ſoreneſs of any Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fearfulneſs of any Death, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the Power, Force, Violence, or Efficacy of that which is the immediate Agent or Cauſe inflicting it. As why do we argue burning or dying by Fire, a more terrible Death, in reſpect of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than drowning in Water? But that Fire, being the immediate Agent or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument applyed to that Execution, hath a more fierce and violent working than Water hath; which diſpatcheth a Man more eaſily. Now therefore the fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſoreneſs of this Puniſhment (and that with difference from that by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, compare for this <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29.) being here argued, that it is <hi>a falling into God's</hi>

                           <hi>Hands;</hi> and we knowing this withal, that he is in himſelf able to work by his fierce Wrath, more powerfully and exquiſitely upon the reaſonable Soul of Man Sinful, than all created Agents whatever; and the Soul it ſelf being alſo capable of ſuch a working upon by him. This doth ſtrongly argue his own immediate Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by his own Hands to have been intended.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In <hi>ver.</hi> 27. he termeth the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Cauſe inflicting this Puniſhment, <hi>A fiery indignation devouring the Adverſaries.</hi> Indignation or Wrath is of ſome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Nature provoked. And whom ſhould this refer to? or whoſe Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can it be ſuppoſed, but of this God, <hi>who</hi> himſelf (as the Apoſtle expounds and comments upon it) <hi>hath ſaid, Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is mine, ſaith the Lord?</hi> And this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation is called <hi>fiery,</hi> becauſe it works as Fire; is in tormenting like to Fire; or as a Flaming Sword, red hot, when it is made the Inſtrument of ones Death, which wounds and kills; and doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a ſuperadded anguiſh. For the further opening of which, I ſhall, at preſent, only ſay two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) That God compares himſelf in this reſpect unto a <hi>devouring or conſuming Fire</hi> in this very Epiſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. laſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60376:12"/> 
                           <hi>Our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> There are two Creatures which God aſſimulates himſelf unto, in contrary reſpects. 1. <hi>To Light,</hi> as often. And <hi>God is Love,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. and both theſe are ſpoken of him in reſpect of what he is to the Saints in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Light is of all Creatures the moſt comfortable: And <hi>in his Light it is we ſee Light.</hi> And the State of Glory is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed <hi>the Inheritance of the Saints [in Light] Col.</hi> 1. The ſecond is to <hi>Fire:</hi> and this on the contrary, in relation to what he is to Men in Hell. And the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel runs upon what he is immediately unto both, by Analogy of Reaſon. Of all Creatures Fire is the moſt dreadful, the moſt raging, ſubtile, and piercing in its Operation; and ſo God in his Wrath muſt be underſtood under that Similitude to be: and therefore it is his Wrath is termed fiery Indignation.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) Thoſe words in their coherence, are an alluſion to thoſe extraordinary Puniſhments executed under the old Law. For in <hi>ver.</hi> 28. he inforceth his Argument (the ſcope of which was to aggravate this Puniſhment as <hi>à minori)</hi> from the inſtances of thoſe Puniſhments that did befal Men that died for deſpiſing <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; ſome of them we read were deſtroy'd by Fire, and therein he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60376:12"/> more eſpecially refers us to thoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who <hi>periſhed through Fire, Lev.</hi> 10. 1, 2. where the very words the Apoſtle here uſed to ſet out this Puniſhment by, are uſed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and ſo more evidently ſhew the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be made thereunto. <hi>There went out Fire from the Lord, and devoured them,</hi> ſays that Text; and yet he argues from thence the ſurpaſſing ſoreneſs of this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment above that, from that Fire, though it were a Fire even from Heaven it ſelf that kill'd them. But more of this hereafter.</p>

This Particle <hi>[From]</hi> (as in Speech we often uſe it) hath led ſome from the true intent of the Apoſtle. They thereupon ſuppoſing this the meaning, that they are puniſhed with Deſtruction <hi>[From the Preſence]</hi> that is, <hi>out of the Preſence of Chriſt;</hi> as if this were the fufilling that Speech of Chriſt, <hi>Depart [from me] into everlaſting Torment.</hi> This, though it be true of this Deſtruction ſpoken of here, in reſpect of Chriſt's local Preſence, conſider him as he is Man, yet, as <hi>Slater</hi> upon the place well ſays; <q>To him that attentively conſiders the Words, the <hi>Cauſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are held forth herein.</hi>
                           </q> For, 1. he ſays not ſimply or alone that they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd <hi>from his Preſence,</hi> but further adds <hi>[from the Glory of his Power]</hi> the ſame Particle <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> or <hi>[from]</hi> being therefore in common to be applyed to the one as well as the other. Now the intent of the latter, <hi>from his glorious Power,</hi> cannot note forth that they were puniſhed out of, or from without his glorious Power, as in reſpect of Abſence; but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60376:14"/> that the Preſence and Efficacy of it is to be that which is the Author of their Puniſhment, ſo that it imports nothing leſs than abſence, or a withdrawment by God, or a throwing them out of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but poſitively an efficiency or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy put forth by him; and ſo carries with it the relation and influence of an efficient Cauſe: If indeed he had added inſtead hereof, either <hi>[from his Glory]</hi> or <hi>[from his Bleſſedneſs]</hi> unto that other <hi>[from his Preſence]</hi> it might have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both unto <hi>poena Damni, the puniſhment of Loſs;</hi> that is, to note out what they had loſt and wanted the Communication of, and ſo their excluſion from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of God's Face and Bleſſedneſs, (which is more ordinarily termed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) and together therewith had noted out an excluſion alſo of this ſenſe which I argue for; but his ſaying alſo <hi>[from the Glory of his Power]</hi> manifeſtly notes Power put forth in Execution, and inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Deſtruction, and glorifying Himſelf, on them thereby.</p>
                        <p>And Secondly, Further know that the Word here uſed is not <hi>poteſtas,</hi> as of a Judg, that is, Authority, whereof <hi>John</hi> 5. 27. <hi>The Father hath given the Son of Man Authority to execute Judgment:</hi> And in relation unto which in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of

                           </gap>, now God's Anger or Wrath is as well, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently expreſſed by his Face in Scripture, as his Favour uſeth to be. For the Face as well holds forth Anger and Wrath, as Favour and Grace. Thus <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>I will [ſet my Face against] that Soul, and will [cut him off]</hi> that is, I will put forth mine Anger to deſtroy him. And <hi>Lament.</hi> 4. 26. where it is tranſlated the <hi>Anger of the Lord,</hi> in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and in your Margents, it is, <hi>The</hi>

                           <hi>Face of the Lord.</hi> As there is the <hi>Light of God's Countenance,</hi> in which <hi>is Life; ſo the rebuke of God's Countenance, at which we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> Pſal. 80. 16. <hi>Even as the Wax is ſaid to melt at the [Preſence] of the Fire,</hi> Pſal. 68. 2. and often elſewhere.</p>
                        <p>So then to be deſtroyed <hi>[from his Face and Preſence,]</hi> is all one as to ſay, <hi>from his Anger and Wrath.</hi> And we have both exegetically met in one Scripture, Rev. 6. laſt. <hi>They ſaid to the Mountains, Fall on us, to hide us [from the Face of him] that ſitteth on the Throne, and [from the Wrath] of the Lamb;</hi> and ſuitably this Deſtruction here in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. is ſaid to be both from God and Chriſt.

                        <p>I Shall inſiſt on this Paſſage but ſo far as it reſpects the Execution of this Deſtruction in Hell, after much Long-Suffering paſſed and not to touch at all; upon any thing of that Point of Rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Eternity, whether intended or not. But that the Words ſhould reſpect the Execution in Hell, (which is the Point only before us) I take that as clear, and much for granted. And the Reaſon is, becauſe it is the Glory of Heaven, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60376:16"/> in the next Words the Apoſtle joins with it, and ſets by it, as Parallels illuſtrating each the other: So ver. 23. <hi>And that he might make known the riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory;</hi> In Heaven namely. The only thing which by the way I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is, That the Sin of the Creature is that which prepareth or fitteth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the execution of this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And a difference may be obſerved in this (though otherwiſe a Parallel) as put in cautiouſly by the Apoſtle; that God himſelf prepareth the Saints to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. but the other are fitted, that is, by themſelves, unto Deſtruction, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. ere he deſtroyeth them.</p>
                        <p>The Point afore me is, that <hi>God's Wrath and his Power are to be the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Inflicters of that Deſtruction.</hi> There are ſeveral Particulars, in the Words, which taken ſingly might perhaps be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove this, but laid all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will become a ſtrong eviction thereof.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God's Wrath and his Power, or the Power of his Wrath, are ſpoken of, as the inflicting or executing Cauſes, is evident: For it is a Power of Efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy here ſpoken of, as whereby God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth this Deſtruction, as a Cauſe doth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60376:16"/> its proper Effect: and accordingly He is ſaid to make known and ſhew his Power and Wrath therein; like as the force and virtue of an efficient Cauſe is made known and demonſtrated, in and by the Effect it produceth. And ſo is ſpoken to the ſame Effect, with what, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 20. he had ſaid, that his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Godhead is clearly ſeen from the Creation of the World, and underſtood by the things that are made.</hi> He that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>poſſe,</hi> or what is poſſible to be done by him. It is then a power of Strength, and Energie, or Efficacy, with his own Hands and Arm, and that according to the utmoſt of his Ability, as the word imports: And ſo the Power here ſpoken of, is an inflicting Power, that works and effects this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and not that of Authority only, or a Power of Liberty to do as one pleaſeth, as <hi>the Potter with the Clay.</hi> For that kind of Power he had afore aſcribed to God in this matter, in the foregoing Verſe, which this Word here is diſtinct from.

It is his Power joined with his Wrath: that is, the <hi>Power of his Wrath,</hi> or his <hi>Wrath in the Power of it.</hi> For thus <hi>Moſes, the Man of God, Pſal.</hi> 90. 11. had long afore put them together, when he ſpeaks of this very Wrath in Hell, of which here the Apoſtle doth. For after he had, 1. ſet out the Time and Condition of Man in this Life, <hi>The days of our years are threeſcore years and ten,</hi> &amp;c. and then, 2. <hi>We fly away:</hi> ſo expreſſing Death, and our going into another World. Then, 3. follows, <hi>[Who knows the Power of thine Anger?]</hi> As that which ſucceedeth and ſeizeth after Death upon the moſt of Mankind dying in their Sins. The Apoſtle here mentions Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Wrath apart, but <hi>Moſes</hi> there maketh Power an Attribute of his Wrath: and ſo conſidered it hath a double mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and both ſerving our purpoſe; 1. That Wrath ſtirs up his Power, and draws it out unto this Execution, and therefore Wrath is the firſt of the two here mentioned: yea further, that it is his Power, as it becomes heated, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and intended by Wrath, that inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this. And as a Man in his Anger ſtrikes a greater blow, ſo may God be ſuppoſed to do, when repreſented as thus ſmiting in his ſore diſpleaſure. And,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60376:17"/> 2. That God's very Wrath and Anger, if but ſhewn and revealed by him, to Mens Souls, hath ſuch a Power in it, that that alone is enough to deſtroy them. The neareſt reſemblance that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <note place="margin">Fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in the Text. Pſal. 22. 14.</note> make of this Wrath, is that of Fire, (of which anon) and that as Fire melting Wax by the very Preſence of it. As therefore when we would expreſs the Power of Fire, we ſay <hi>[the Power of the Heat]</hi> that is in Fire, that thus melts and conſumes, &amp;c. Its heat being in it ſelf ſo fierce and vehement a Quality, that when but applied, it thus works: So here; it is the <hi>Power of his Wrath.</hi> If it be <hi>kindled but a little, that deſtroys,</hi> if but made known once, or diſcovered. And, as in the Text, it is a <hi>ſhewing his Wrath,</hi> and thereby <hi>his Power</hi> in <hi>deſtroying, is made known.</hi> It is but his being Angry, and ſhewing it. And this is the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that his very Wrath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, ſhould have this Power. And how receptive the Conſcience is of it, I ſhall after ſhew. <hi>As,</hi> in <hi>his Favour</hi> (if <note place="margin">Chap. 6. of this firſt <hi>Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                           </note> but manifeſted to Mens Souls) <hi>is Life, Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. <hi>So,</hi> in his <hi>Anger,</hi> when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by himſelf, there is <hi>Death. If the Wrath of a King be as the roaring of a Lion;</hi> and <hi>where the Word of a King is,</hi> there is Power; then what is the Terror
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60376:18"/> and Power of the Wrath of the Great God? That alone ſtrikes dead. And thus underſtood, it is an Argument of it ſelf alone, that the Power of his Wrath doth ſpeak an immmediateneſs of God's Execution.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond Particular is, that that which makes God willing by reaſon of Sin to execute this, is thereby to <hi>obtain a Glory unto his Power, by ſhewing his Wrath.</hi> So as, that although he hath already ſhewn his Power in creating the World at firſt, and upholding it by the Word of his Power, and other Effects, that yet over and above, and beſides all this, he takes the advantage of Sin, to ſhew (as the <hi>riches of his Mercy</hi> in ſaving from Sin, ſo) the Greatneſs of his Power, another way, namely, in deſtroying for Sin. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in that 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9. there is a peculiar Glory attributed unto that Power of his, from or by which Men are deſtroyed; [puniſhed <hi>from the Glory</hi> (ſays that Text) of his <hi>Power]</hi> or from his Power, giving a Demonſtration, or ſhewing his Glory therein: that is, unto that end that it might be known how <hi>great and powerful a God</hi> he is in Himſelf, <hi>by the Judgment which he executes,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks.</p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60376:18"/>
                        <p> Now then, from hence, ere we add the other two Particulars, the Argument ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thus: That if God ſhould execute this by Creatures only, and not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by himſelf, he attained not the full of this his End: and that upon a double Account.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe, when all had been done, that could have been, by his powerful arming and ſetting on of Creatures to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Sinner; yet ſtill himſelf being able to give a greater Demonſtration of Power this way, if Himſelf would take it in Hand; and the Soul of Man being fully capable of his immediate workings upon it; and Sin alſo deſerving it: and the Wrath of God being firſt or laſt to come upon impenitent Sinners to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt: <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 16.</note> Therefore until this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration were given, he had not made a full proof of his Power: Which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here profeſſeth to be his aim.</p>
                        <p>And, 2. In that after all other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Demonſtrations of Power given in Creation, Miracles, in <hi>Converſion of Souls,</hi> that is, <hi>Take his creating part in it, &amp;c.</hi> All which He hath done, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Himſelf, without the intervention of created Influences, that he ſhould, laſt of all, be willing to give forth anew, or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60376:19"/> ſhew forth his Power afreſh in this Work alſo; and yet ſhould not then give a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of like immediate Power, but execute it only at ſecond Hand by Creatures alone: this would fall ſhort, and hold no Proportion with that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er already ſhewn forth in thoſe fore-paſt Works; and then this being the laſt, or one of the laſt, after all his other Works ended, purpoſely to ſhew forth his Power in, it had not been ſuch a Demonſtration of Power, as in his laſt Work (wherein he profeſſeth to ſhew forth any Attribute) he uſeth comparatively to give: For ſtill his manner is, in the ſhewing forth of any Attribute, to give greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations thereof in his latter Works then in the former: Of which more afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Add this to it, which heightens this Argument. That the Apoſtle ſpecially ſingleth forth this Attribute of Power: and by way of eminency mentioneth it, in ſpeaking of this Puniſhment, as that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, whereof God is willing to give fulleſt Demonſtration, in this work, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any other Attribute, or Attributes, in Himſelf, therein. In all the great works of God, ſome one ſpecial Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute hath ſtill the Honour given it, as being in a way of eminency put forth;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60376:19"/> as in Man's <hi>Salvation, Mercy and Grace,</hi> Eph. 2. 9. In Man's <hi>Glorification, Riches of Glory and Mercy,</hi> as here <hi>ver.</hi> 23. But look down into Hell, and it is his Power, which (as here in difference from thoſe other) is ſaid to be the predominant Attribute, that he would ſhew forth, and which appeareth, there. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of theſe two, Salvation and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as they ſtand in an oppoſite Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, this in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and the other in <hi>ver.</hi> 23. doth confirm this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; taking in withal that other Paſſage in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9. where they are ſaid to be puniſh'd <hi>from the Glory of his Power,</hi> which manifeſtly gives the Glory unto his Power, in this Work, above any Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. His Soveraignty and Authority is ſeen in Salvation as much (if not more) as it is in Deſtruction. <hi>I [Will] have Mercy on whom [I will,] &amp;c.</hi> But his Power or Omnipotency, that is ſaid to be ſeen in deſtroying for Sin. Whereof perhaps one reaſon is, becauſe there is ſhewn in this, a duplicated Power: a contrary Stream of Power running croſs and thwart, in its Effects, in this. For at the ſame inſtant (and that lengthned out for ever,) God ſets Himſelf by his Power to <hi>deſtroy the Creature,</hi> utterly, in reſpect of its Well-being: Whilſt yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60376:20"/> on the other Hand, as great a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is requiſite to uphold it in Being and Senſe, and to prevent its ſinking into its firſt nothing, or from failing afore him, in reſpect of Being to bear it. And in that reſpect to continue the Creature to be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to endure the weight of God's Power in Wrath, to be dry Stubble in a Flame never conſumed; this is more then for God to create. This puts the great God upon a double expence of Power.</p>
                        <p>A third Particular, in this <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. that contributes to this, is: That, As the Cauſe inflicting is termed the Power of his Wrath, ſo the miſerable Subjects hereof are denominated Veſſels of Wrath: Even as on the other ſide, thoſe ſaved, are termed Veſſels of Mercy. Common uſe of Speech tells us, that Veſſels or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be filled with ſuch or ſuch <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,</hi> have their Denomination, from that matter they are ordained to contain, and are filled withal. You ſay this is a Veſſel of Oyl, that a Veſſel of Wine; theſe here you ſee are ſaid to be Veſſels of Wrath. If you demand <hi>whoſe Wrath? God's. What if [God willing to make known his Wrath.]</hi> Now as touching its oppoſite here, <hi>[Veſſels of Mercy,]</hi> all will acknowledg that when it is ſpoken of as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60376:20"/> in relation to Heaven (as here it is) that importeth, Souls their being ſet apart to be <hi>immediately filled with the Love and Mercy of God: that as God is Love,</hi> ſo that they, as Veſſels, ſwim in that Ocean for ever: That they dwell in God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and are filled with <hi>fulneſs of him.</hi> And why ſhould not then, this other of being Veſſels of Wrath, be intended in the ſame Senſe alſo, and that Senſe be urged accordingly? Eſpecially ſeeing it is evident that one ſcope of the Apoſtle here, was to make a Parallel between the eternal Glorification of the one, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Deſtruction of the other; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly between what are to be the Cauſes of them. And if ſo, the Law of this Parallel will alſo carry it to this, that as the Saints in Heaven have an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Participation of God, that likewiſe in Hell, there ſhall be oppoſitely, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Participation of God's Wrath. In Heaven they are not ſaid to be Veſſels of Mercy, becauſe God ſhews them Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, only, by created Benefits or Gifts beſtowed; or becauſe they have God's Mercy communicated by Creatures (though it muſt be affirmed that there is a confluence of theſe) but becauſe <hi>God himſelf appears all in Love, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to them.</p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60376:21"/>
                        <p> And it is not nothing, that, according to the ſame Analogy of Speech, unto this Particular, in multitudes of Scriptures in the New Teſtament. This Deſtruction is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, by way of Singularity, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, and ſimply ſtiled Wrath; and the Wrath of God. And ſo it bears a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that Denomination from all other Puniſhments by Creatures (except that by Magiſtrates in God's ſtead, and who bear the Image of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5.) ſo bearing the Name of its immediate Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> he began that ſtile in the New Teſtament. <hi>[The Wrath to come,] Mat.</hi> 3. by way of deſtinction from all that is executed in this Life. And the whole New Teſtament afterwards much uſeth that Phraſe. As when the day of Judgment is ſtiled <hi>the day of Wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. And elſewhere. It is equivalent to ſay a <hi>Child of Hell,</hi> Mat. 23. 15. And a <hi>Child of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. To ſay, <hi>fitted to Deſtruction,</hi> as Rom. 9. and <hi>ordained to Wrath,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 9. To ſay, <hi>Damnation haſteneth,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 3. And, the <hi>Wrath of God cometh on the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Col. 3. 6. As in like manner on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Saved from Wrath,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Wrath through Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> is all one, and, <hi>ſaved from Death</hi>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60376:21"/> 
                           <hi>and Hell,</hi> elſewhere. And this is uſually termed the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> ſo <hi>Joel</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Col.</hi> 3. 6. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22.</p>
                        <p>That which I would obſerve from both, is, that according to the general Analogy of common Speech in all Languages; the puniſhment as the Effect, bearing the Denomination of that, which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſtrument of the principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in that Puniſhment. (Thus the torture by the Rack is called the Rack: whipping the Rod. So in Deaths, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying was termed the Croſs, Hanging the Gallows: Thus 'tis in the Puniſhments which Men execute.) That in like Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Speech this ultimate Puniſhment ſhould ſo generally be termed Wrath, and the Wrath of God, by way of eminency and difference from all other fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning effects of Wrath, executed by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this Life; this ſtill ſtrengthens the former Notion, that it is indeed the Wrath of this God it ſelf, in a way of eminent difference from what by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he doth in Wrath pour out, that is the inflicter of that Puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall for the cloſe of this, caſt in one Scripture-Teſtimony more, both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Interpretation of Wrath given upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and the whole of the Point in hand. It is</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I obſerved afore from the ſecond Verſe of this Chapter, how that this Puniſhment was termed both the <hi>Judgment of God, ver.</hi> 2. as denoting God to be the <hi>Judge,</hi> and alſo <hi>[Wrath,]</hi> as of God the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Now in theſe Words <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. the Apoſtle purſueth the latter more fully, when he ſays, <hi>Indignation and Wrath, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and Anguiſh to every Soul of Man.</hi> Theſe are two pairs or Conjugates of Cauſes, and Effects. 1. <hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> as the Cauſes. 2. <hi>Tribulation</hi> and <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> as the two Effects; and that on the <hi>Souls of Men,</hi> which are the Veſſels of this <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Indignation,</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that <hi>Tribulation</hi> and <hi>Anguiſh</hi> thence ariſing. And truly his inſtancing in the <hi>Soul,</hi> which (though it often ſignifies the whole Perſon, yet) here ſeems purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, as being that in or of Man, which alone is immediately capable of this <hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, and the Impreſſions or Effects of <hi>Anguiſh</hi>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60376:22"/> there-from, and is the proper ſeat of that <hi>Anguiſh</hi> and <hi>Tribulation.</hi> And that Phraſe of Wrath, its being ſaid to be <hi>[treaſured up]</hi> in the <hi>5th</hi> verſe, ſuits this.

                     <argument>
                        <p>That this immediate Wrath of God is in Scripture ſet forth unto us under the Similitude of Fire, and fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. The Examples of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons devoured by Fire in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, Shadows of this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the immediate Wrath of God. This the Fire wherein the Devil and his Angels are tormented.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere hath been nothing more diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Thoughts of Men from apprehending, or ſo much as imagining God's immediate Wrath to be a cauſe of that Puniſhment in Hell; then that the Scriptures do ſo often make mention of Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Inſtrument thereof, and ſo Mens conceptions do terminate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and go no further.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall rather on the other hand, make an Argument of it. Namely, that indeed the Scriptures do ſet out this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Wrath of God under the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Reſemblance, and Repreſentation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60376:23"/> of Fire; and that, ſometimes, when Hell-fire is ſpoken of, the Wrath of God is intended thereby.</p>
                     <p>Unto which I yet Preface this: That I muſt not, nor dare I ſay that there is no <hi>material Fire in Hell</hi> ordained for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to Mens Bodies: but that it is Rational, that the Body having ſinned as well as the Soul, it ſhould have a meet recompence of Reward ſuited thereto, as well as that the Soul ſhould. But yet ſo, as either of them have this meeted out to them, according to their vaſtly differing ſhare, and hand, and acting which they had in ſinning; in which the Soul is always the principal Actor, and in ſome Sins the ſole Agent and Subject. To be ſure in Heaven there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of created Excellencies, ſuited to the Bodies of Saints, made Spiritual, as well as God Himſelf, the Happineſs of their Souls; and ſure I am that on the contrary, it is diſtinctly ſaid of each and apart, That God deſtroys <hi>[both Body and Soul]</hi> in Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, each of them, with a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuited unto each.</p>
                     <p>The Paſſage of Scripture, unto which the gathering will be of ſeveral others, for the proof of this my preſent Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (which is the ſubject of this Chapter,)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60376:24"/> is that of our Apoſtle in the 28. <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. a little afore my Text; he there ſetting forth the Judgment to come, in the Cauſes and Effects of it, to be,</p>
                     <p>A <hi>fiery Indignation, devouring the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I did but touch upon it before, when I drew out other Arguments from this Text, but then reſerved a fuller handling of this by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The Original hath it, <hi>[The Indignation of Fire.]</hi> But Indignation is in, and from the Heart of an intelligent Perſon provoked, which is God, as the Text ſhews. <hi>Grotius</hi> therefore interprets it, <hi>The Anger of God,</hi> but adds, <hi>putting forth it ſelf by Fire:</hi> I ſuppoſe he means by corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Fire, as its Inſtrument. But why not rather <hi>The Anger of God Himſelf, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring his Adverſaries, as Fire;</hi> and ſo to relate to the manner of his Anger its working, as repreſented under the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Fire, ſeeing God Himſelf is, in this Epiſtle, ſtiled <hi>a Conſuming Fire?</hi> which interprets this.</p>
                     <p>And in this Expreſſion of <hi>[fiery Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which Devoureth,]</hi> He hath particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reference unto thoſe, of all other, the moſt extraordinary Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Nadah</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Lev. 10. 2.

This as for what examples is referred unto.</p>
                     <p>Now to raiſe up our Thoughts, unto how much a ſorer Puniſhment, the fiery Indignation that remained for theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Adverſaries ſhould be, he ſuggeſts how tranſcendently the Goſpel exceeds the Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> in theſe Words that follow; <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Law died without Mercy, under two or three Witneſſes, of how much ſorer Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the Blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace.

But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the New Covenant, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enlightned thereby, have been ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <hi>by the Blood of the Son of God.</hi> If

                     <p>That Maxim of the Judicial Law which is annexed, that <hi>Deſpiſers died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy under two or three Witneſſes;</hi> is brought in for that grand Circumſtance's ſake, whereby the Apoſtle heightneth both the Iniquity of thoſe Perſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Fire, who ſinned afore many thouſand Witneſſes, the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> As likewiſe, this other far tranſcending guilt of theſe Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who had renounced Chriſt and his Blood openly, afore the whole World and Chriſtian Church.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60376:26"/> and Wrath, inſtead of thoſe other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers, with which Sinners have now to do, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Do you provoke the Lord to Jealouſie? are you ſtronger than he?</hi> I might confirm this Notion from other Types, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44, 45. This fore-laid.</p>
                     <p>To approach nearer to our purpoſe in hand, there are two things further to be done: 1. as touching the Type it ſelf, what kind of Fire that was which devoured them: And the manner of their Deaths.</p>
                     <p>The Fire was another manner of Fire, than this our Elementary common Fire. This was Fire from Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be a <hi>Fire [from the Lord] that devoured them;</hi> it was ſuch a Fire, as blaſts of Lightning are, which ſtrike, and blaſt, and ſhrivel the Spirits of a Living Body in an inſtant: which is evident by the manner of their Deaths. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors ſay of it, that it was a <hi>Fire which burnt their Souls, not their Bodies;</hi> their meaning is, their Bodies were not conſumed or devoured by it: for <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. 5. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They carried their Bodies and Coats into the Tent,</hi> as untouch'd. It was therefore ſuch a Fire (as Lightning is from Heaven) which uſeth to ſtrike, and lick up Mens Spirits in an inſtant, when yet in the mean time, it conſumes not, breaks not ſo much as Skin or Fleſh;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60376:27"/> which our Elementary Fire preys firſt and moſt upon. It was therefore a far ſubtiller Fire then <hi>Culinary</hi> or Kitchin Fire: which ſuitably ſerved as the fitteſt and neareſt Type of this fiery Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and of the vengeance, which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes. And this was but the Shadow.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, What the ſubſtance an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to theſe Types ſhould be? This I ſhall ſet out by two things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What is the thing, or ſubject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by this fiery Indignation? <hi>It is the immortal Souls of Men:</hi> theſe are the Fewel which this Fire doth prey upon. As to the truth of the thing it ſelf I need not inſiſt on it: But the Analogy of that as the Shadow; and this as typified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that is the matter afore me.—Let it be conſidered, that the Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the immortal Soul in Man, could not any other way be more lively ſhadowed forth, than by ſuch a devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as <hi>Moſes</hi> word is) or licking up the vital and animal Spirits that run in the Body, when yet the Body it ſelf remains unburnt: Thereby demonſtrating, that it was ſuch a Fire as ſtruck immediately at that which is the Fountain of Life it ſelf in the Body, and at that which is the Bond, the <hi>Vinculum,</hi> the Tye
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60376:27"/> of Union between Soul and Body: for ſuch are thoſe Spirits. And yet not ſo much, as to ſinge the outward bulk or carcaſe of the Body. There could have been nothing invented in the whole compaſs of Nature, to have born a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance ſo near, to ſhadow forth the Immortal Soul, as thoſe ſpirits running in Man's Blood and Arteries, do; which, ſome affirm to be the very Animal and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul in Man. Sure I am, they are as the Oyl whereby Life is preſerved and fed; and in the Blood is the Life, ſays <hi>Moſes,</hi> our beſt Interpreter in this. Neither doth this Shadow hold a Similitude in this particular only, but in another like caſe as evidently. The pouring forth of the Blood of the Beaſts that were Sacrificed under the Old Law, was particularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſignify Chriſt his pouring forth his Soul unto Death, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks; As well, as in general, that the Sacrifice of thoſe Beaſts did typifie forth Chriſt's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, in the whole of it. And this was as near a Repreſentation of that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as could any way be made, by what was corporeal in Beaſts, or elſe in the whole Creation (for a Sacrifice of Mankind, or the Blood of Men, God liked not to be made to him, in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) could poſſibly have been found to pourtray it forth.</p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60376:28"/>
                     <p> The ſecond thing is, that the ſubſtance ſhadowed forth by that Fire, was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Indignation or Wrath of the great God Himſelf, which is termed Fiery Indignation here.</p>
                     <p>For Proof of which, I inſiſt not, that ſome <hi>Shim</hi> thereof this Shadow it ſelf doth caſt, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſaying again and again <hi>in Terminis,</hi> that <hi>a Fire [from the Lord,] &amp;c.</hi> which hath a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis and Reſemblance of this in it. But for proof I ask,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Where ſhall we find, or how <note place="margin">Omnes ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hujus Mundi ſunt ut ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Pictus ad ignem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                     <p n="3">3. Let us conſider other Scriptures, which (as I ſaid) do gather about this, to give Teſtimony to this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 33. 14. <hi>The Sinners in Sion are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: Who among us ſhall dwell with the [devouring Fire?] Who among us ſhall dwell with [everlaſting burnings?]</hi> I ſhall afterwards have occaſion to take notice of this Scripture by way of Uſe. In the mean time,—obſerve, that it is God Himſelf, who is meant by this devouring Fire, here. For in a ſmart and quick Retortion, (and it is a moſt Elegant one) the Prophet gives Anſwer: <hi>He that walketh Righteouſly, and ſpeaketh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightly, He ſhall dwell with Him</hi> (whom you that are Hypocrites ſo much dread, and have cauſe enough to do ſo) with him ſhall an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man dwell:</hi> Who is, and will be unto you in the State you are in, <hi>A Devouring Fire.</hi> And <hi>thus they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi> and taught what it is to be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, by the oppoſite condition of the Upright, and the differing Event of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch. And further, that it is God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60376:29"/> Himſelf there the Prophet intendeth, as with whom the Upright ſhould dwell: The Words following do alſo ſhew, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>He ſhall dwell on High</hi> (namely with <hi>that High and lofty one, that dwells in the High and Holy Place, &amp;c.</hi> Do but pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually compare that <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57. 15. with this here) likewiſe <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Thine Eye</hi> (O thou upright Soul) <hi>ſhall ſee the King in his Beauty;</hi> that is (as Chriſt ſays) <hi>the pure in Heart ſhall ſee God.</hi> The reſult is, that the ſame God, who appears all in Flames, and as a devouring Fire, unto Hypocrites in Hell; is all Light and Beauty to the Upright in Heaven. Like as unto a ſound and vigorous Eye, <hi>It is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks; but to ſore Eyes it is a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
                     <p>Add to this <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21. 8, 9. <hi>Thine Hand ſhall find out all thine Enemies, thy right Hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee. Thou ſhalt make them as [a fiery Oven] in the time of thine [Anger:] The Lord ſhall [ſwallow them up] in his [Wrath] and [the Fire] ſhall devour them.</hi> This the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt interprets of the Fire of Hell. And ſo you have all meet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this Fire to be meant of the Wrath of God himſelf. Firſt, <hi>God a conſuming Fire, Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> Then 2. God himſelf
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60376:30"/> to be <hi>that devouring Fire,</hi> Iſa. 33. 14. And 3. his Wrath interpreted to be that Fire by the Pſalmiſt. And loe how theſe all meet in this one ſaying: <hi>The fiery Indignation that devours the Adverſaries.</hi> Which the Apoſtle himſelf, alſo interprets of God himſelf, afterwards. <hi>We know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance is mine. And it is a fearful thing, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Particularly for that Scripture, even now cited, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. If we conſult the Context, the occaſion of bringing in that horrid out-cry, <hi>who among us, &amp;c.</hi> (as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters agree) was that the Prophet had ſet forth, in the Verſes before, that moſt wonderful and prodigious ſlaughter of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>'s Hoſt, when an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foreſcore and five thouſand</hi> (as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 15.) were in one Night deſtroyed by an Angel. And thereupon, the Prophet in this Paſſage is to be underſtood, either to have related what an impreſſion of dread this ſo unparallel'd a Judgment had made upon, and ſtruck the Hearts of the Hypocrites in <hi>Sion</hi> with: As that which had made them to cry out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Oh how then ſhall we dwell with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting burnings?</hi> That is, with <hi>God Himſelf.</hi> For they may well be ſuppoſed to have reaſoned thus with themſelves;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60376:30"/> if one Angel that is but a miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to God, is able to blaſt and conſume ſuch a Multitude in one Night; how ſhall we have to do with God Himſelf, who is that infinite immenſe devouring Fire, and all thoſe Angels but as Sparks, and his Miniſters. And ſo according to this meaning, themſelves are brought in, ſpeaking by the Prophet, as the Men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> did upon the like Judgment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Who is able to ſtand before this holy Lord God?</hi> Or elſe thoſe Words may be ſuppoſed to have been the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets own Meditation and uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deduced from that example; which he uttereth, as fore-warning the Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> to conſider, That if God be ſo terrible in the Judgments he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes by others, his Angels, who are Flames of Fire; how will you endure to <hi>dwell with God Himſelf,</hi> and have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to do with him for ever, who is a <hi>devouring Fire and everlaſting Burnings?</hi> &amp;c. And our Saviour's Speech is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, from this of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when, ſpeaking of Hell, it is the <hi>Fire prepared for [Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites]</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 51.

                     <p>If it be objected out of my Text, Is it not ſaid, <hi>He cometh in flaming Fire with</hi>

                     <p>I anſwer, 1. This Fire here is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as that which is the Cauſe of their everlaſting Deſtruction: but as that which is a concomitant of Chriſt's Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and alſo a fore-runner or Harbinger
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60376:31"/> to that Judgment, he comes to pronounce Sentence of, whereof the Deſtruction that follows is the final Execution.

                        <p>A ſecond ſort of Proofs. Demonſtrations from Inſtances both of Wicked Men and Holy Men, who have felt in this Life Impreſſions of God's immediate Wrath: And that ſuch Impreſſions are Evidences of what, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is in Hell.</p>

                     <p>A Second ſort of Proofs, are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations from Inſtances, in Scripture, of Perſons in this Life, who have felt Impreſſions of this Wrath of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60376:33"/> God in their Souls, upon God's rebuking them for Sin. And theſe Inſtances of Experience, upon Record, being added to thoſe fore-gone Scripture-Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, will ſerve as ruled Caſes, joined unto Maxims in Law, alledged both of them, for the proof of one and the ſame thing; and will give yet more clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration what is meant by Wrath, and what Hell is in the fulneſs of it: And being joined to the former, do altogether, give an abundant evidence of this great Truth.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, 1. Of <hi>Men in this Life:</hi> And if any ſhould deny the Truth hereof, or that which we have been proſecuting, themſelves perhaps ere they dye may be made miſerable Examples verifying of both; and out of their own woful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, live to confeſs and acknowledg the Truth herein. For God doth in this Life ſingle out ſome, both of his Children, and others; to whom he gives a taſte what the one ſhould for ever have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, but that Chriſt did it for them; and of what the other muſt under-goe for ever, without Repentance. Whereof thoſe Inſtances that follow, are undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidences.</p>
                     <p>And 2. <hi>Theſe Terrors are wrought by God's immediate Hand:</hi> And from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60376:33"/> Impreſſions and Repreſentations of his Wrath, made by him, on their Souls, and to their Conſciences. For as God puts Joy into the Hearts of his Children in this Life, by the immediate Light of his Countenance, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Lord lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon us,</hi> and ver. 7. <hi>[Thou haſt put] Gladneſs in my Heart, more than in the time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed;</hi> And again, <hi>whom though we ſee not, yet believing [we rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and glorious]</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe Primitive Saints: Even ſo when he is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke Man for Sin, he doth the like, in a way of Contraries, on Men both Good and Bad; correcting them, by and with Anguiſhments from the like immediate Stroaks of his own Anger. God is the Father of all Spirits: and of the Spirits of his own Children upon a double Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And <hi>if the Fathers of our Bodies</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9. See for theſe things more largely, <hi>The Child of Light walking in Darkneſs.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>corrected us,</hi> and had power to do it with bodily Puniſhment, by bodily Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; do we think that our Souls which lie <hi>naked afore God, Heb.</hi> 4. 13. are not as immediately ſubject and expoſed to his Correction, <hi>as a Father of Spirits?</hi> And if ſo, that then he may and doth ſometimes chooſe to correct even his own Children with no other Rods but of his own:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60376:34"/> which are the immediate Emanations, ſtreamings and dartings of his own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Which when they feel, they wax pale and wan, and wander up and down, like unto Ghoſts in Hell, as if they were cut off by his Hand. And that thoſe Anguiſhments which either of theſe feel, are from God's immediate Hand alone; thoſe that have felt the ſmart thereof, do readily acknowledg: for it is not in the power of any Creature to ſtrike ſo hard a ſtroak.</p>
                     <p>And you ſhall hear ſome of themſelves, by and by, ſpeak out ſo much, whilſt they were under the preſent ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Theſe things premiſed,</p>
                     <p>There are two things to make this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration compleat.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, the Inſtances themſelves of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this Life; On the evidence of which, the main ſtreſs lies, for the proof of the Aſſertion.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, that ſuch immediate Impreſſions of Divine Wrath, are Evidences of what kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, which in the fulneſs of it, befalleth Men in Hell; and that both proceed from the ſame immediate Cauſe.</p>

                     <p> The Inſtances are of two ſorts: That ſo we ſtill may have under two or three Witneſſes, this Word eſtabliſhed.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Heman</hi> complains at the third verſe of that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. <hi>My Soul is full of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp;c.

And <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 16. he ſets out his condition ſuch, as wherein there was not only a privation of God's Favour, and that God ſeemed to reject his Soul, as if he never meant more to look upon it, or regard it; ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Why caſteſt thou off my Soul?</hi> But further, poſitively, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>I ſuffer thy Terrors.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Thy fierce Wrath goes over me, Thy Terrors have cut me off.</hi> The blows which God gave

Theſe are Notes and Degrees beyond, and higher than the <hi>Ela</hi> of Dolours from or by the hands of Creatures, though ſet on by God: They are Strains of another Key, the doleful Air of which doth ſound another hand and ſtroak, (purely Divine) that did immediately ſtrike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Heart-ſtrings that ſpake theſe things. Theſe are the reſoundings of blows and ſtroaks which God's own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand gave upon the bare Spirit, of one wounded by him; he that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively liſtens to them, will ſoon perceive and eſteem (as they ſaid,) this Man <hi>ſtricken and ſmitten of God himſelf.</hi> Creature-diſtreſſes give a far leſs report.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60376:36"/>
                     <p> But that it was God's own immediate hand, is more plainly by himſelf expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Thy Terrors have cut me off,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>while I ſuffer thy Terrors, I am diſtracted, and ready to dye from my Youth up</hi> (as in the ſame verſe) <hi>Thy Terrors,</hi> ſo he termeth them (he ſpeaking to God) or the Terrors <hi>[of Thee]</hi> that is, firſt, From Thee efficiently, and from thy hand ſetting them on. And 2. Of Thee as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing <note place="margin">As <hi>David</hi> ſtiles his Thoughts of God. Pſal. 139. 17. <hi>Thy Thoughts.</hi>
                        </note> in me from and with dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and thoughts of Thee (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,) and of Thy ſore diſpleaſure repreſented to my Soul, by Thee. And ſo God's Terrors, are every way, ſet forth in diſtinction, from diſtreſſes, from Creatures, or ſuch as are made mediately by or from Creature-afflictings; although they alſo be from God. Thus in like Phraſe of Speech it is appoſitely ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Be not afraid of their Terror,</hi> he ſpeaks it of Men that were Perſecutors, and threatned the Saints. <hi>[Their Terror] ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè;</hi> That is, <hi>The Terror of them,</hi> or that Terror which the apprehenſion of their <hi>Power, Greatneſs, Strength, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, &amp;c.</hi> may poſſibly work in you. In a like Senſe thy Terror here is ſpoken of God. And the other great Apoſtle ſpeaking of this ultimate Puniſhment of Hell, he in like Phraſe, termeth it, <hi>The</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60376:36"/> 
                        <hi>Terror of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. That is, that Terror which is peculiar and proper to him, in and to the Souls of Men, who is the terrible God (as he ſtiles himſelf in <hi>Moſes)</hi> and ſays <hi>Nahum, Who can abide,</hi> or, <hi>ſtand in the fierceneſs of his Anger?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are further, two effects, which <hi>Heman</hi> there relateth, of this his having ſuffered theſe Terrors; or that befel his Spirit whilſt theſe Terrors were upon him. 1. That he was continually ready to die: the Wrath that lay on him was ſo heavy, as it even well-nigh thruſt his Soul out, every moment, and made the Spirit to fail: And ſecondly, it made him not himſelf (as we ſay) put him out of his right Mind. <hi>Whilſt I ſuffer thy Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors I am diſtracted.</hi> For the intention of a Soul taken up with, and extended by the Wrath of God is ſuch; and is wound up ſo high, as the String is ready to crack. You uſually term this, in ſuch Perſons deeply wounded, <hi>[trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,]</hi> (but that is more common) whereas this Diſpenſation requires an higher Word, it is indeed [the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> or the Terror of God in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence] making it as a fiery Oven within it ſelf, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks. This for the inſtances of Good Men.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60376:37"/>
                     <p> A ſecond Inſtance is of Bad and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men. What was it cauſed <hi>Judas</hi> to hang himſelf? The Prophecy of the Pſalmiſt, and the Apoſtles reference to it, have reſolved us. That it was the <hi>Curſe or Wrath of God entring into his Soul.</hi> The Pſalm is the hundred and ninth, which was penned on purpoſe about him; the Apoſtle's Reference and Application is in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 20.—In the Pſalm 'tis ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>as he loved Curſing,</hi> that is, Sin which is that accurſed thing, afore God, ſo the <hi>Curſe of God came into his Bowels</hi> (or inwards) <hi>like Water,</hi> and <hi>like Oyl into his Bones,</hi> and filled all within him full of Anguiſh and Torment. And ſo was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that Saying, Indignation and Wrath, namely, of God, cauſed Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Anguiſh in his Soul. The Similitudes or Alluſions there are Elegant. That as there are Spiritual Oyls which Mens Bodies being annointed withal, they ſoak into the Bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they cool, refreſh, and repair Spirits, and Strength, and allay fervent Heats and Pains; into which more inward parts, other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines more craſſe and druggiſh cannot ſoak, or come. In the way of a contrary vertue or effect, he compares the Curſe of God on his Soul, unto a ſpiritual Oyl
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60376:37"/> of a piercing, penetrating Violence, that ſtrikes in, as Quickſilver, into the Bones, and Nervous Parts, and fills them with unſufferable Torments. He compareth alſo this Curſe, and the Effects of it, unto ſuch painful Diſeaſes as are cauſed by ſharp Corroding Waters in the Bowels; as of the Gout in the Bowels: which when it poſſeſſeth thoſe Inwards, is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and intolerable. The Apoſtle's Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion elſewhere is correſpondent to both theſe of the Pſalmiſt, when he ſays, The Word of God (through the Power of the Spirit) <hi>is a ſavour of Death unto Death</hi> in ſome Mens Hearts, as <hi>of Life unto Life</hi> in others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. The meaning whereof is, that look as venemous and ſulphurous Vapours and Damps in Mines and Caverns ariſing out of the Earth, do ſtrike up ſuch ſcents or ſmells, as often kill, by extinguiſhing the Spirits of thoſe that deſcend into them: Such exhalations of Hell and Wrath, doth the Spirit of God, by the Word preached, exhale and draw forth, and cauſe to aſcend in ſome Mens Conſciences, which gives them the very ſcent of Hell it ſelf: They are the Savour or Odour of Death afore-hand, <hi>[unto Death]</hi> and Damnation, and ſo are Vapours of the ſame kind: out of the ſame Matter that is laid up in the Mine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60376:38"/> or Treaſury it ſelf; as thoſe out of the Earth uſe to be.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing requiſite to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the compleating the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, That ſuch immediate Impreſſions of Divine Wrath in this Life, are ſure and certain Evidences (I ſay not as to what Perſons, but) of what kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, which in the fulneſs of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth Men in Hell; and that both do proceed from the ſame immediate Cauſe. This needs not much probation, for the Inſtances afore given, carry their own evidence with them of this thing to any intelligent Reader. And this general Reaſon for it, will readily occur to any ones Thoughts, that ſurely God will not puniſh them in Hell with a Puniſhment of leſſer ſort or kind (for we ſpeak not now of compariſons of Degrees) than what his Diſpenſation reacheth forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Men, in this Life. For that is the proper day, and time, and ſeaſon of Wrath, and of the fierceneſs of his Wrath; in which the Fruits of their own doings, are every way in their full Ripeneſs and Maturity to be returned to them: and theſe inflictions in this Life are but the Buds and the Blooms that preceed; yet both from the ſame Root and Cauſe.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60376:38"/> Now to be puniſh'd by God's Wrath but mediately, through the force only of created Inſtruments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as of material Fire, or the like, (if that were all the Puniſhment there); this were certainly by a lower kind or ſort, than to be puniſh'd immediately from the Wrath of God it ſelf. As will abundantly appear in the ſecond Section, when I ſhall ſet out the dreadfulneſs of ſuch a Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>But let us particularly weigh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances themſelves, as we have ſingly, and apart delivered them.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Thoſe Diſpenſations to <hi>wicked and bad Men,</hi> as <hi>Judas, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The ſame, as they are exemplified in <hi>good and holy Men,</hi> as <hi>Heman, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And either of them will afford an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the proof of this Propoſition in Hand.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Theſe direful Impreſſions of God's immediate Wrath, when they do befal wicked Men, what are they to them? Not only Pledges or Fore-runners of that Puniſhment to come (for ſuch all ſorts of Afflictions are unto wicked Men.) But further theſe are Spices and Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and leſſer intermitting Fits of thoſe future fiery, burning, and continued Calentures and Feavers; yea, Earneſt-Penies of Hell: and ſo of the ſame kind,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60376:39"/> with what in full Men ſhall there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                     <p>As we uſe to ſay and ſpeak of thoſe glorious Joys, which ſome Saints afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand have the priviledge to partake of, that they are pure drops of thoſe Rivers of Pleaſure, flowing immediately from the ſame Fountain of Life: So we may as confidently ſay of thoſe breakings forth of Wrath upon wicked Mens Souls here, that they are the <hi>ſippings</hi> of that <hi>Cup of Wrath without mixture</hi> (as the <hi>Revelation</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 10.</note> diſtinguiſheth it from thoſe in this Life) whereof the Wicked muſt <hi>drink the Dregs,</hi> though it be Eternity, unto the bottom. And therefore we may make a true and warrantable meaſure, of what all ſuch Men are to look for in Hell, by what ſome few of them do partake of here.</p>
                     <p>And the Argument is ſtrong every way, from the one of theſe unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as Heaven and Hell are Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel in a way of contraries, as out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. hath been ſhewn: So thoſe unſpeakable glorious Joys, and theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extraordinary Horrors and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, on the other hand, do hold Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel alſo, in being (in their ſeveral kinds) Prelibations and Taſtes of what is to come in the other World. And in this very poſture and tendency doth the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60376:39"/> Apoſtle ſet theſe two Diſpenſations toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Life, in a Parallel way, (as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. he doth the other) whilſt in the ſame Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16. He compares thoſe Joys (common in thoſe times) in them that are ſaved, to the breakings forth (at the opening of the Goſpel, as of a Box of Spiknard) of <hi>a ſweet Odour or Savour of Life unto Life,</hi> (namely of the Life to come) afore-hand, ſenſing their Souls with ſome of thoſe Perfumes that are fetcht from that Country, and only grow there: and on the contrary, ſuch alſo he declares thoſe precurſory Savours or Odours of Death in their kind to be, which do ariſe from the threatnings of the ſame Word in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors upon many that periſh, which he pronounceth to be the very Evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that <hi>Lake of Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 14</note> 
                        <hi>which is the ſecond Death,</hi> in ſtiling them the Odour or <hi>[Savour of] Death [unto Death]</hi> ſo ſpeaks he. Theſe Men often ſmell the ſcent of Hell in their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Spirits of it do ſtrike up into their Souls. The very Aſhes and Smoak of that <hi>Veſuvius</hi> or <hi>Aetna</hi> of Hell, (I allude unto the laſt Words of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 22.) do fall upon them, which lighting upon Men in this Life, do, as thoſe <hi>Aſhes of the Furnace (Exod.</hi> 9. 8, 9, 10.) miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60376:40"/> did, they cauſe ſores and blains upon Mens Conſciences. And however if the Apoſtle did therewithal intend the more common Diſpenſations by the Word, and ſo both the ordinary and extraordinary, of which we now ſpeak. Yet ſtill take and compare thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Joys in the one, as a Savour of Life, with the extraordinary Horrors, that are the Savour of Death, unto the other; and in their Proportion there is ſtill the like reaſon of both, as to the matter in hand; and an alike perſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy in either of thoſe two eternal Eſtates.</p>
                     <p>Again, that each of theſe are alike, by and from God, and by his more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand diſpenſed. This I take from that <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28. and ſubmit the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. Where exhorting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unto an holy courage and confidence in their appearings (for the Cauſe of Chriſt) afore their Perſecutors Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals: <hi>In nothing be terrified by your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> ſays he. And upon ſuch a bold undauntedneſs on their part, two effects he tells them do often follow; and <hi>both from God</hi> alike, as two wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects. Firſt, in themſelves, God elevateth and raiſeth up that their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Faith into a glorious aſſurance
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60376:40"/> and <hi>taſte</hi> of Heaven and Salvation, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are a going; ſo in theſe words, <hi>Which is a token to you</hi> (your ſelves) <hi>of Salvation.</hi> But on the contrary, which is, <hi>an evident token</hi> (namely, in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor's Conſciences) <hi>of Perdition,</hi> if they repent not, <hi>and that</hi> (namely, both theſe effects) <hi>[of God.]</hi> Two things I obſerve: 1. That theſe two contrary Effects run parallel ſtill, and that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to, and of their being <hi>Tokens</hi> either of <hi>Salvation</hi> or <hi>Perdition;</hi> as in that other place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. And ſo that as the Joys put into the hearts of theſe Confeſſors, are the <hi>firſt Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> therefore of the ſame kind with what Fruit and Harveſt they reap in Heaven; and thereupon alſo a Spirit of Glory (is ſaid) <hi>to rest upon them</hi> in ſuch a caſe; it being it ſelf <hi>initial Glory,</hi> and the <hi>firſt fruits of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Glory,</hi> in a way of Glory. Thus on the contrary, thoſe Terrors God ſtrikes their Adverſaries hearts withal, are like To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and Evidences of Hell, no other than the Suburbs, <hi>the first fruits of Hell, and ſhadow of Death.</hi> And, 2. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, (which is that for which I quote it) that both theſe extraordinary effects are alike wrought in the hearts of either, by the ſame or like hand, namely, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from God.</hi> The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60376:41"/> adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, unto both, <hi>[and that of God,]</hi> He being the immediate Author of the one as well as of the other; and both unto a like, tho contrary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And the reaſon why God thus often takes that ſeaſon and occaſion to put forth his immediate power in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of either, at ſuch a time, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Glory is in no paſſages of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in and upon Earth ſo highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and engaged, as upon ſuch Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, wherein both his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> are brought to the Bar at once, and therefore is then pleaſed to diſcover ſomething more than ordinary (tho ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly) in the Spirits of Men. <hi>Have they no Fear</hi> (ſays the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that eat up my People like Bread?</hi> One would think ſo, they look ſo big, and fall too ſo heartily to devour them: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, anſwering it, <hi>there were they in great fear. [There]</hi> that is, upon ſuch an occaſion, at ſuch a time; and yet the ſame Pſalmiſt tells us, that <hi>there was no cauſe of fear,</hi> (compare for that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 54. 4.) that is, not from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. What was the matter then? or whence comes this great Fear? <hi>God is in the Generation of the Righteous,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt; thence was their fear: [and <hi>that of God].</hi> So the Apoſtle in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60376:41"/> that very caſe. God takes part with his Children, and ſo ſtrikes and terrifies their Adverſaries Souls, as he comforts theirs; and this is to them an <hi>evident Token,</hi> and as the firſt <hi>Baptiſms, Waſhings</hi> or <hi>Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> of that <hi>Perdition,</hi> which their Souls will be everlaſtingly drowned in (as the Apoſtle's alluſion is in <hi>Timothy)</hi> if they turn not.</p>
                     <p>The truth and real verification of both theſe ſo immediate effects by God, and from God, (he as with a double-edged ſword ſtriking contrary ways at once.) Multitudes of Inſtances of both kinds the Story of the Martyrs doth relate; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the examples of thoſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Emperors <hi>Galerius</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath Recorded them. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that lamentable out-cry in the ſixth Seal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Which the Kings of the Earth, and mighty Men</hi> (the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors) are brought in ſo loudly utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in <hi>ſaying to the Mountains, Fall on us, and hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others have applyed (as the Time and Order of the Viſions of that Prophecy require) unto thoſe Great Perſecutors in the Roman Empire, whom authentick Antiquity hath related to have been terrifyed and ſtruck with horror, by God and the Lamb, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60376:42"/> extraordinary ways of confuſion; and thoſe Terrors, ſuch, as Stories have related them, as were the livelieſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of that <hi>Great Day of Wrath,</hi> ver. 17. And are therefore ſet out under the Notion thereof, as having been to them the very imperfect beginnings of it. This for the Argument from the inſtances of wicked Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Argument is as ſtrong, though not ſo direct, from the inſtances of holy Men.</p>
                     <p>For, 1. This Diſpenſation to them, is not only an Argument in common with other Afflictions of <hi>this World, in their being a manifeſt token of the Judgment of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>God;</hi> and that therefore a ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judgment is to come upon the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he there argues. But this kind, being a Judgment of a ſpiritual Nature (as immediate inflictions of Wrath are) and properly belonging unto Souls, as they are the Subjects of the other World: It argues therefore upon a more proper account that the Puniſhment to come is of the ſame kind therewith.—And ſuch they muſt needs be, unleſs we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that God whips his own Children in this World with Scorpions, but wicked Men in the other World, but as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60376:42"/> with Rods in compariſon of them. For it muſt be acknowledged, that theſe God's own blows, from his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate hand, are ſorer, and cauſe wounds of a deeper blew, than what are given by him through Creatures. Surely God hath not laid up gentler Rods for the wicked in Hell, then he puts in ure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Children: <hi>Have I ſmote them as I ſmote thee?</hi> Eſay. 27. 7. <hi>I will correct thee in meaſure,</hi> Jer. 30. 1. not ſo <hi>them.</hi> The equity of thoſe ruled Caſes, (which the Reader may conſult) <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 15, 16, 17, 28, 29. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 31. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12, 17. do hold in this, and give us warrant in like manner to argue, That if his own Children do drink of ſo <hi>bitter a Cup</hi> here: then ſurely You, the <hi>Wicked of the Earth,</hi> ſhall much more drink of the very ſame. And theſe Scriptures alleaged, and the ſtrength of this our Inference, are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into that of <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78. 8. <hi>In the hand of the Lord is a Cup, whereof the wicked of the Earth ſhall</hi> (finally) <hi>drink the dregs.</hi> And the force thereof lies in this, That if ſuch kind of Judgments and <hi>fiery Trials</hi> as theſe (I allude unto that ſpeech of the Apoſtle) thus falling upon their ſpirits from God himſelf, do <hi>begin</hi> at ſome of <hi>the Houſhold of God,</hi> then <hi>where will the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and Sinners appear?</hi> For his own
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60376:43"/> People do but begin in this Cup to them, who are to drink the dregs, whereof themſelves have but the droppings.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This diſpenſation of <hi>impreſſions of Wrath,</hi> when it doth befal either the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or the Wicked, although there are differing ends and purpoſes from God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards either; yet as they are one and the ſame in ſubſtance (as other afflictions are) ſo alſo they meet in this one and the ſame iſſue, namely, to be an evidence and demonſtration what <hi>Hell it ſelf</hi> in the extremity of it is. For as in the <hi>Wicked</hi> they are imperfect Teſtimonies of what they ſhall undergo, to the end they may repent; ſo in the <hi>Godly</hi> they are Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of what they have deſerved in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with thoſe, and all wicked Men; and to ſhew that they are <hi>alike Children of Wrath, even as others;</hi> alſo unto them, <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> they are ſenſible Experiments of what they ſhould have undergone, but that Chriſt hath ſaved them <hi>from the Wrath to come,</hi> that ſo they may be <hi>thankful,</hi> &amp; love much. And many other holy ends there are; yet ſtill ſo, as theſe contrary lines do centre in this, that Hell is prelibated and taſted by the one as well as the other.</p>
                     <p>But for a clear Eviction, that theſe <hi>Terrors</hi> in the <hi>Godly</hi> are no other than the very <hi>ſhadow of Death,</hi> or <hi>vive</hi> and lively

                     <p> Let us ſee what evidence of Reaſon each of theſe apart do afford, much more put together.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Justice.</hi> Concerning that the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That if there be a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made for <hi>Man</hi>'s <hi>Sin</hi> unto God's <hi>Justice,</hi> but ſo far as it may be attained upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be puniſh'd in Hell, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will ſet his immediate hand to it, and Juſtice requires this.</p>
                     <p>The Explication.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſay, <hi>A Satisfaction, ſo far as may be attained</hi> upon the Creature that hath ſinned, and which is to be the Subject of this Puniſhment. I put this in, becauſe otherwiſe it muſt be affirmed of Chriſt alone, that he gave full ſatisfaction unto God's Juſtice, in whom there was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of <hi>God's Juſtice for Sins that were past:</hi> yet ſtill, as although a full Satisfaction can never be had from or upon the Creature, (therefore in Hell they alwas ſuffer) yet God doth recover what can be had, and payeth himſelf out of them as far as it will go; as thoſe Phraſes, <hi>Paying the utmost farthing,</hi> Mat. 5. 26. and, <hi>Selling them and all they had, to make Money thereof,</hi> Mat. 18. 25. do ſhew.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60376:45"/> 2. In this caſe, that which juſtice will require unto any tolerable equitable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this Puniſhment, is, that as exact a proportion be obſerved, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly there may be, and as the Subject is capable of. The Juſtice of God <hi>as it is according to Truth,</hi> ſo exactneſs and equity: and the work of God is perfect in every kind; and performed in due Weight, Number and Meaſure, but above all elſe, where Juſtice is profeſſed. You may hear Juſtice ſpeak in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 59. <hi>[According] to their Deeds,</hi> [According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] <hi>he will repay recompence to his Enemies.</hi> There is an <hi>[According]</hi> and an <hi>[Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly]</hi> to that: So as all due Meaſures and Rules of Proportion every way ſhall be obſerved. Which Meaſures being ſet out in this matter, will evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that God's immediate Hand is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required thereto.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let the demerit of Sin be weighed: And for that in the General, I refer unto the firſt of theſe Treatiſes of the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin. And we ſhall find, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the craſſer part of Sin is an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate luſting after, or enjoyment of things created, or ſinful Comforts in Creatures; yet that the great and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation evil of it lieth in an averſion or turning off from God, and therein and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60376:46"/> thereby there is a reflecting upon God an immediate ſlight or undervalue, to an infiniteneſs of diſhonour and contempt caſt upon his Goodneſs, Bleſſedneſs, that is to be had in him; as alſo to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, Prerogative, Supremacy, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are ſhewn forth and laid at Stake of every of his Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Sin is the Tranſgreſſion. Now if indeed it could have been ſuppoſed, that Sin were nothing elſe but that groſs and craſs part ſpoken of, the enjoyment of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, than a puniſhment by Creatures only, might equivalently, have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with that its obliquity of debaſing its own excellency unto Creatures: But it being an immediate reflection upon God Himſelf, none can fill up the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a meet and full Puniſhment, which Juſtice doth require for this, but God Himſelf. I may make uſe of <hi>Eli's</hi> ſpeech, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>If one Man ſin againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Judg ſhall judg him, and revenge it: but if againſt God, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> Thus he. And upon the ſame or like ground of Reaſon I infer, if one Creature wrong another, a Creature of the ſame kind can revenge it. If a Man ſhed Man's Blood, ſo far as it is wrong to the bare Creature, <hi>By Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed;</hi> ſo ſays the Law in relation to Man's
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60376:46"/> day in this World: But if Man ſin againſt God, who ſhall recompence it, when God's day comes wherein he is to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed? none, ſo as to give ſatisfaction to his moſt exact Juſtice, but God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yea further, if we retained to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of many Learned Men, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s enjoyment of God for ever, in that holy Eſtate of Innocency, ſhould have been of God, but as manifeſted in and by Creatures, and his holy Law, and not as in Himſelf, or as in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this would not ſerve for a Rule whereby to eſtimate, or make proportion, that therefore this Puniſhment ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitely be only <hi>from God, by and through Creatures.</hi> For whatever his enjoyment ſhould have been, whether of God me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or of God as in Himſelf immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, I diſpute not: yet to be ſure when God was caſt off by him, or is by us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and directly reflected upon, <hi>[even God as God]</hi> which is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every Man's Sin is heightned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. the meaning whereof is, that <hi>God as in Himſelf</hi> is debaſed by Sin. So that as the Apoſtle ſays in the like caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>[Not as the Offence, ſo is the free Gift.]</hi> On the contrary, upon the like ground, <hi>Not as was the caſe or merit of</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60376:47"/> 
                        <hi>Adam's Righteouſneſs, ſo is the demerit of Sin;</hi> and ſo, nor of Puniſhment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo tranſcendent an undue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yea, an injury done to the great God Himſelf by the Creature in Sinning, over and above the proportion of all created Grace or Obedience. For all Obedience was due, and all Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in obeying was from the meer goodneſs of God, which He, and his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and all depended upon: and ſo the proportion thereof is no way to be lookt at, either as the meaſure of the evil of Sin, or of what is to be the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof. Sin we are ſure is ſo great an Evil, as no meer Creature, but Chriſt God-Man, and his Obedience or Suffering could have ſatisfied God for, in the behalf of another. And why may it not alſo be ſaid, that as none but He, that was <hi>ſubjectivè</hi> God, could ſatisfy God for the demerit of Sin, committed againſt God <hi>objectivè?</hi> ſo that Sin is ſuch an evil, as cannot in the Sinner himſelf be throughly puniſhed unto the ſatisfaction of Juſtice, but by God Himſelf efficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that is, God, to be the inflicter thereof immediately.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond equitable rule of Proportion, that Juſtice (requiring the fulleſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that may be had) will exact, is that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60376:47"/> the <hi>principal Author and Actor in the Sin ſhould principally bear the Puniſhment.</hi> This not only Vengeance (which is the ſecond Topick) doth in a more eminent manner aim at, and affect, but Juſtice doth call for it alſo; The Juſtice both of God, and Men. Now the principal in Sin is known to be the Soul of Man. Which I ſhall urge, when I come to ſhew how Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance alſo ſeeketh to wreck it ſelf thereon. That which ſerves to my preſent purpoſe (which is this, that in the point of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to be made unto God's Juſtice, it is moſt proper for God Himſelf to puniſh Sin in the Soul) in order thereunto, is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to enquire, What is it in Soul or Spirit of Man, which God, when he comes to deal ſtrictly and down-rightly, as a Judg of Mens Souls, hath principally to do withal? All muſt acknowledg that it is Conſcience that hath to do with God as a Judge: for it muſt be that in Man, which is the moſt proper ſeat of the guilt of Sin, which guilt is the obligation unto Judgment and Puniſhment. And this to be Mens Conſciences, the Scriptures hold forth, and every Man's own Soul feels. Hence alſo to be purged from an evil Conſcience, is all one, and to be perfectly acquitted from the Guilt of Sin. And for God no more to remember our Sins, or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60376:48"/> to be atoned with us as a Judg; is all one as to ſay, that we on our parts have no more Conſcience of Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2, 3, 10, 11, 17. verſes compared. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is that part of the Soul, whereby God as the Judg arraigneth every Man. It is the Hand which a guilty Soul holds up at God's Bar for all the reſt of Man; and is God's Witneſs within Man againſt himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. and that in order unto Judgment, as follows in <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>Again, 2. I enquire, when it ſhall come to the execution of the Puniſhment ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, What is it in the Soul or Spirit of Man that is moſt directly and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of Anguiſh and Torment, and what that part is, which God may moſt properly ſtrike a Man's Soul in, when he would rebuke him for Sin? Certainly, ſtill a Man's Conſcience. All Beaſts have one tender part above any other, that moſt grieves them, if ſmitten: This, in guilty Man is Conſcience. We ſee it in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> God burnt them both in this Hand; in the Hand of Conſcience in this World.</p>
                     <p>Having by theſe two Enquiries, ſtated the Principal, both in Guilt, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seat of the Execution; I ſhall for the Proof hereof, as alſo in order to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60376:48"/> the clearer making forth the Argument afore us, namely, <hi>that Juſtice requires God's immediate Hand, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall in a more ample manner ſet together theſe five en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Aſſertions.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt, That Conſcience, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual or underſtanding Power in Man's Soul, are God's <hi>Engagee,</hi> and the Principal in a double reſpect. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is reſponſible for the whole in Man: or if you will, principal in the Obligation. As being that, which, by its own acknowledgment of a Judgment, made unto God, when he ſhall come to judge, binds over it ſelf, and with it ſelf, the whole Soul for the Payment. And upon that account is to be reckoned the chief <hi>Obligee:</hi> and therefore the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is juſtly to be ſerved upon it, and through it upon the whole Soul. 2. If we take in together with Conſcience, the underſtanding part in Man; the <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia,</hi> or the Spirit of the Mind in the ſummity of it; That is really to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted alſo the Principal, in reſpect of its ſhare in the very acts of Sinning; ſo as juſtly the Guilt of every act is refund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, as the principal Actor. For it is betruſted by God, with the ſteering and management of the whole Soul, with the conduct of it, as the General. By
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60376:49"/> reaſon of that Light, God at firſt ſeated in it, it was appointed for ever to be the Guide and Leader of the Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And therefore God juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the account, or the defaults and miſcarriages of the whole, at its Hands. According to the equity of thoſe Rules declared concerning Rulers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>Theſe have known the way of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> As alſo from that other like to it, given forth touching the Prieſts, and which we find ſo often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in <hi>Ezekiel, I will require their Blood at the Prieſts Hands.</hi> And all theſe founded upon one and the ſame common ground, common unto Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with theſe; namely, Conſcience and Knowledg there being the Guides: And yet, in that Conſcience gives but an ineffectual weak warning againſt Sin (which ſhould powerfully ſway the whole) and the Spirit of the Mind, or the practick Underſtanding doth ſtill wickedly give ſecret conſent unto Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence therefore that denunciation in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> holds, that God will <hi>require the Blood of</hi> (the Soul) <hi>at its hands.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Soul</hi> (the Will and Affections) <hi>do periſh too,</hi> in their Iniquity as it is there ſpoken. And, for this cauſe it becomes Juſtice to puniſh this chief Agent and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60376:49"/> Offender, or this great <hi>Miniſter of State</hi> in ſinning, and to make theſe the Seat of the Execution above any or all other Faculties.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It will furthermore agree with the Rules of <hi>Justice,</hi> yea, it will be a ſpecial Trophy unto <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to have <hi>Sin it ſelf</hi> in the Guilt of it, made as far as poſſibly to be it's own Tormentor, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the higheſt Puniſhment in and unto the Soul that hath ſinned. There is <hi>no Sword like unto that,</hi> will Juſtice ſay, to ſlay a Sinner withall. It is of all other the moſt proper and exquiſite way of puniſhing. For the Sinner to <hi>eat</hi> (for ever) <hi>of the Fruit of his own Ways, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>to be filled with their own Devices; and their Iniquity to ſlay them.</hi> This is the juſteſt and higheſt Doom which Wiſdom it ſelf can invent, or God's Power exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. The very ſame doth <hi>Jeremy</hi> alſo ſpeak, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>Thine own Wickedneſs ſhall correct thee; know therefore, and ſee, that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for the Sinner to feel in the moſt intimate and immediate manner that may be, the bitterneſs of the Guilt of Sin; and to find that <hi>that,</hi> above all other Puniſhments that can be inflicted, is the ſharpeſt and ſevereſt: this is a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60376:50"/> ſtrain of Juſtice indeed. Now this is moſt exquiſitely accompliſh'd through that proper capacity which <hi>Conſcience</hi> and the <hi>intellectual part</hi> in Man have as to this very thing: And in their being the Seat of the <hi>Guilt of Sin,</hi> they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by further fitted to become the Veſſel or Receptacle of this the higheſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is in a great meaſure veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 11, 12. <hi>We roar all like Bears:</hi> And what was it that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this? <hi>For our Tranſgreſſions are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied before thee, and our Sins teſtify against us: For our Tranſgreſſions are with us,</hi> (they dwell with and <hi>poſſeſs</hi> us, and we <hi>poſſeſs</hi> them, as <hi>Job</hi> alſo ſpeaks): <hi>And as for our Iniquities, we know them.</hi> It was their very <hi>knowing</hi> of their Sins, as ſet on by God, that made them thus <hi>roar,</hi> which is the loudeſt and wildeſt Tone of Grief, and Note of inſufferable Torment. And obſerve, how that <hi>that</hi> Knowledg had two things in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which cauſed the <hi>Roaring:</hi> 1. Sin, together with the Wrath of God. <hi>Our Tranſgreſſions are multiplied afore thee.</hi> And ſo they had God in their eye as a Judge; which thoſe words ſhew, <hi>We look for Salvation, but it is far from us,</hi> v. 11. And, 2. <hi>They teſtify against us.</hi> This was the accuſation of their own Conſciences
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60376:50"/> themſelves. So as it was <hi>Conſcience</hi> which was the Seat, the Habitation, (as it were) where theſe two took up their dwellings, continually quartered upon, and poſſeſſed. <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſays the ſame, <hi>To ſee and know how bitter a thing it is to ſin,</hi> &amp;c. And though theſe Scriptures ſpeak not immediately of <hi>Hell,</hi> yet they do clearly point out to us, what, and wherein the moſt exquiſite puniſhment of Sin lieth, and by what effected; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Knowledg of Sin and Wrath:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Men in forerunning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in this Life, or hereafter in Hell in the fulneſs of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is not, nor can it be the meer Spiritual evil that is in Sin, as <hi>Sin is Sin,</hi> and an oppoſite to <hi>true Holineſs,</hi> and as it ſtands in a contrariety to the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God; that is not it which Men in <hi>Hell</hi> ſhall ſpiritually know and ſee, ſo as to lay to heart the evil thereof in that reſpect: No, for that is the peculiar effect of Grace, and proper to the Saints; even as to ſee the <hi>Beauty</hi> that is in <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as it is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is—It is therefore Sin in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effects thereof only, whereby Souls ſtill remaining wholly ſinful, (as thoſe in Hell do) can come to know this <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60376:51"/>
                     <p> Now to proſecute this: The evil of Sin is not ſufficiently or perfectly felt, no, not in the effects of it, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a Sinner, (ſo as it may be) until it be felt in that which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt tranſcendent, and proper, moſt immediate and firſt-born effect thereof, of all other. And that is no other than the Wrath and Indignation of the All-powerful God: For that his Wrath ſhall break in upon the Sinner, and ſo conſidered, it is the moſt proper effect of all other of the demerit of Sin, God being ſtirred up and provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by Sin. <hi>Do you provoke the Lord to Jealouſy?</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 22. The like, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 19. Sins are as a heap of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, wicked Mens Conſciences the <hi>Oven,</hi> and God's Wrath the <hi>Fire:</hi> Let this <hi>Fire</hi> be put into this <hi>Coal,</hi> and let both meet in a guilty Conſcience, and it inſtantly becomes a <hi>fiery Oven</hi> within it ſelf. And as concerning all other Puniſhments, I may ſay it, That all other, of <hi>what kind</hi> or from <hi>whomſoever,</hi> although they are all the effects and deſerts of Sin, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in <hi>Jeremy: [Thy way, and thy doings have procured theſe things to thee,] and this is thy Wickedneſs;</hi> as it follows there in <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 18. Yet ſtill theſe are all of them deficient, and fall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60376:51"/> ſhort in repreſenting unto the Heart and Conſcience the demerit of Sin, even ſo far as by the effects it may be known, and the Soul yet further is capable to feel: But if once the Wrath and Indignation of the Great God come into the Soul and Conſcience, this when felt doth bear ſome anſwerable proportion, as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, unto ſo great an Evil as Sin is, which it hath deſerved; and when revealed unto and impreſſed upon the Sinner's Conſcience, it hath alſo the fulleſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of ſuch an Evil (even to the Sinner alſo) as Sin juſtly deſerveth, as far as any way the Creature is capable. Then it is that the Sinner feels, and takes in the evil of Sin, not as in ſecundary outward effects only, (and ſuch all other Puniſhments whatſoever are in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Wrath of God, and therefore fall ſhort) but in this caſe it feels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the demerit of Sin, in that which is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>only</hi> Cauſe, the <hi>highest</hi> Cauſe of all other ſecundary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments which Sin hath alſo deſerved, whereof it alſo is the cauſe. And this Diſpenſation of immediate Wrath riſeth up unto the exacteſt demonſtration of the evil that is in Sin, which any way from <hi>Effects</hi> can be made or given unto the Creature.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:60376:52"/> 4. Of this immediate Wrath (as it is an evil of Puniſhment) the Conſcience and intellectual part in Man's Soul is not only capable to be made the Veſſel, the Receptacle thereof, but it lies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly expoſed unto it. It is <hi>bare and naked unto him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 13. as in reſpect to God's knowledg, ſo of God's puniſhing, as I have elſewhere ſhewn. <hi>Conſcience</hi> is as an open Door or In-let; or as an open Window is to the Sun, ſo it to God, for him to come in at at any time. That when ever God will but take upon him to perform and execute the part of a <hi>Judg</hi> and <hi>Avenger,</hi> a <hi>Conſcience</hi> that is guilty lies expoſed nakedly and barely unto his Anger, to receive the ſtrokes and impreſſions of it. For I ask, What is <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Juſtice againſt Sin,</hi> but his <hi>juſt Anger</hi> againſt Sin? (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5. the Original hath it.) And what is a guilty Conſcience, but that in Man that is naturally ſuſcipient or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of it? And theſe two are ſuited as Faculty and Object, and are (as it were) made one for the other; there needs no third or other thing (if God but pleaſe to hold forth his Anger, and apply the Corroſive to the Sore, ſo this unto the Soul) to convey his own diſpleaſure by; <hi>Conſcience</hi> hath an ear
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60376:52"/> to hear what God will ſpeak, without any <hi>Medium</hi> to convey the Voice. Look as <hi>Faith</hi> is a Principle peculiarly fitted to take in God's free Grace, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; ſuch is <hi>Conſcience</hi> (when guilty) unto God's Wrath, immediatly ſuſceptive of it. If God will but <hi>ſet a Mans Sins in order afore him,</hi> and withal ſay unto Conſcience, <hi>I am angry;</hi> yea, look but angrily, and preſent himſelf as ſuch; then Conſcience inſtantly, like the ſenſible Plant, is ſtruck, ſhrinks, and falls down. <hi>For if God be angry but a little,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. laſt, <hi>and rebuke us in his Anger,</hi> Pſal. 6. 1. then, <hi>at the very rebuke of his Countenance we periſh,</hi> Pſal. 80. And it is moſt certain that God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Anger to the Soul immediatly, as well as his Favour. And what is this Puniſhment we are ſpeaking of, but the <hi>Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God, revealed,</hi> as afore others, ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to a Man's own Soul? as <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. And what is that <hi>Judgment,</hi> but God's Judgment, expreſſed, as in ſentencing, ſo in ſhewing his Anger and Wrath againſt Sin? as the whole ſtream of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhews. It is therefore the Wrath and Face of God and the Lamb, when diſcovered, which a guilty Conſcience flies from, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16. That, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſays,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60376:53"/> 
                        <hi>Animus ſibi male conſcius potius ad Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ipſum ferretur, quam ad Deum accede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret:</hi> It had rather be brought afore the Devil, and ſee his face, than ſee God's. <hi>Terror of Conſcience,</hi> what is it, but all one and God's Wrath in Conſcience? See it in its contrary: <hi>Peace</hi> (which we call <hi>Peace of Conſcience) which paſſeth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> is rather denominated the <hi>[Peace of God] which paſſeth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. than <hi>Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> although Conſcience be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject pacified, and whoſe Peace and <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etus eſt</hi> it is. And in like manner Terror is ſtiled, the <hi>Terror of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. And theſe things may perhaps afford as true a Light towards the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that Maxim of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>Indignation and Wrath, (viz.</hi> of God,) <hi>Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul</hi> (as the ſeat of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh) <hi>of Man that doth evil,</hi> as any other. And withal ſhew how it comes to paſs, that this <hi>Tribulation</hi> is executed from that <hi>Wrath,</hi> even by the <hi>reception of Conſcience.</hi> For of Conſcience alſo the following words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. do there ſpeak, and that as in order unto <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> verſ. 16.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I add, as a Corollary from this, that <hi>Conſcience,</hi> though it be thus naked and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60376:53"/> open to God and his Wrath, yet it is ſo great a <hi>ſecluſe,</hi> ſo faſt and privy a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, ſo intimate a Power and Principle, in and unto the Soul it ſelf; and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſerved unto God himſelf, who is the Lord thereof: as it is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſubjicible to, or to be broke open by Creatures: No, not thoſe who are ſuperiour Spirits to it, either Angels or Devils; they are not able to terrify the Conſcience, until it hath been firſt made raw and tender by God. God only made the Heart, and God only knows the Heart, and God only can come at and ſtrike at the root of the Heart. The Devils or Angels can come but into an outward Room, the <hi>Fancy,</hi> and caſt in Images thereinto; the Fancy being the Souls Looking-glaſs, wherein it vieweth its own thoughts, and from which it takes off into it ſelf the Species that are caſt in there. Alſo they may ſtir bodily Paſſions (both which I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewn) but they cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cloſet of the Soul. God only is <hi>intimior intimo noſtro,</hi> as the Ancients expreſs it; <hi>God only is greater than our Hearts,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it. Conſcience is a Book ſo faſt claſp'd, as it is God's Prerogative alone to open it; which he then at that day will do: and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60376:54"/> thereunto, that likewiſe may be applied, <hi>He openeth, and none ſhuts; and he ſhuts, and none opens.</hi> That Speech holds as true of Conſcience, as of any other thing. And as it is a Book which he alone can open, ſo in which he alone can write over every Man's Sins, not with Ink, but with Wrath, which, like <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> every letter of it ſhall eat into the Soul. According unto that in <hi>Job: Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and cauſest me to poſſeſs the Sins of my Youth,</hi> Job 13. 26. Let no Man therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Devils are the greateſt Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors of Men, or of their Conſciences in Hell: or if any would affirm it, I would demand, Who it is that torments the Conſciences of Devils themſelves? Certainly none but God. They now believing there is a God, do tremble; but in Hell they fear him, and for ever have to do with him. And it is as ſure, that the ſame God, with whom thoſe Spirits and their Conſciences have for ever to do, the Conſciences of Men ſhall alſo.</p>
                     <p>And as for all other <hi>mediate</hi> or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ways of Judgments executed, in which the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, but as at the ſecond hand, take the ſoreſt and ſevereſt of them that ever
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60376:54"/> God executed by Creatures; yea, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all of the ſeveral kinds of Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judgments (I call them ſuch which are executed upon Men in this World afore-hand) which God hath, <hi>as Judg of all the World,</hi> in his riding Circuit through all Ages ſince the Fall, <hi>revealed his Wrath from Heaven</hi> by, againſt all ſorts of Unrighteouſneſs of Men, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaking of theſe Judgments ſays, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.) Suppoſe, I ſay, they were let flie upon any one Sinner, all at once, yet would they not reach or touch that Man's Conſcience, further than as God ſhould, over and above the efficacy of them, ſtrike the Conſcience it ſelf with his anger and diſpleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed more or leſs by himſelf therewith. And, although in all ſuch Judgments his goings forth are as of a Judg, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies ſuch Judgments more or leſs, but as with ſome ordinary light and glimmerings of an angry Deity; yet his coming as a Judg upon Mens Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at the <hi>Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God</hi> (as if he had never revealed his Wrath before) this is another manner of coming, and ſhewing himſelf a Judg indeed, rendring Indignation and Wrath upon the Souls of Men: And of that Judgment it is, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60376:55"/> ſame Apoſtle in the ſecond Chapter treats, as of that other in the former.</p>
                     <p>And I may ſay of all the former, in compariſon to this latter, that they all are but as the Batteries of the Out-works, and as Bullets ſhot againſt the Walls, in a Siege, which may indeed terrify the Inhabitants, and make them tremble; <note place="margin">Deut. 32. Rom. 2.</note> and ſo theſe the Soul, as by remote ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Suburbs of it. But the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is as ſhooting in of Granadoes, which have been laid up with him in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, carrying Fire from thence in them, the Fire of his fierce and ſoreſt Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and theſe himſelf alone can ſhoot into the inwards of Mens Souls. And this is as ſhooting Fire into the the very Magazine, into that which is the moſt inward in the Soul, and fortified againſt the entrance of all created Powers; the Magazine where all the Gun-pouder lies, that is, the guilt of a Man's Sins: ſo as there needeth nothing elſe to blow up all. If his Wrath doth but touch, it takes, and ſets all on Fire.</p>
                     <p>Yea, give me leave upon the ſame ground, and by the like reaſon, further to ſay, That all the material Fire in Hell, by which the Soul ſhall and will ſuffer by way of a Compatibility (as it is termed) or ſuffering by and with the Body an
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60376:55"/> unſpeakable Torment; and this for the Sins a Man is guilty of: yet theſe Flames nor theſe Puniſhments (taken materially, and abſtracted from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of God's Wrath) would not break into Conſcience; not until God did therewithal break in with the Fire of his Wrath, and make the Conſcience and intellectual Spirit of the Mind a fiery Oven within it ſelf, as the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21. 9. almoſt in theſe very words.</p>
                     <p>This being the ſtate of matters between God, the Judg of all, and the Souls and Conſciences of Sinners, as touching that due and equitable Puniſhment for Sin, and the execution thereof, which Mens Souls are capable of: I ſhall now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the reaſon, why the Juſtice of God ſhould move him to be willing; yea, and that there is in reſpect unto Divine Juſtice a kind of requiſiteneſs (if not neceſſity) for the Great God to take this courſe to puniſh the Sinner, by the Revelation of his own immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Wrath. And this I ſhall do, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together what hath been ſaid, from which the Arguments for both theſe two Aſſertions that follow, lie fair.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That God for his Juſtice ſake ſhould be willing.</hi> For Conſcience being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60376:56"/> Engagee obliged unto God as a Judg, and the underſtanding Power in Man the eminent Tranſgreſſor, and both lying ſo naked and immediately expoſed unto God's Wrath, and capable to receive the Revelation of it. An Anguiſh made thereby in the Soul, is the moſt proper, natural, ſuitable Reward unto Sin, to pay the Sinner home in his own Coin; as alſo the moſt ready, direct, and ſhort way for God to take.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we ſuppoſe Juſtice be left to have but its free and full courſe; if <hi>Juſtice</hi> (according to the Prophet's lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and God's own rule and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given unto us) <hi>run down as Waters,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream,</hi> in its proper natural Channel, and ſo as to fall into that moſt capacious Veſſel or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle that is in Man to receive it. Again, if Divine Juſtice hath a will to put and lay its charge and execution where principally it is to be laid, even againſt the Principal, whether in the Obligation for Sin, or in the guilt of the Act of ſinning. Or if it be deemed, that Divine Juſtice will take a recovery where the fulleſt and faireſt advantage lies, and recover his principal Debt of that which is the principal Debtor; and from that in Man which is capable to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60376:56"/> afford the moſt due ſatisfaction and puniſhment, as being that which is the Treaſury of all the Guilt of Sin, and moſt exquiſitely capable to ſuffer, and thereby to make fulleſt payment for all. Then we may conclude that aſſuredly God is willing to wreck his juſt Anger, and in his Wrath to break forth upon the Conſcience and Intellectual Faculty of the Sinner in Hell, by the immediate Revelation of his Wrath, and that upon all the accounts fore-mentioned, thereby to puniſh it.—And we may well ſuppoſe that his Juſtice is willing to do this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is (as the Pſalmiſt with an <hi>Emphaſis) Judg Himſelf,</hi> Pſal. 50. 6. And <hi>judgeth for Himſelf,</hi> Prov. 16. 4. And for the Recovery of his own Glory, and Revelation of his Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this Courſe of immediate Wrath being a way above all other ſo natural, ſo ready, ſo direct, ſo compendious, and ſo ſuited to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of Sin, (as hath been ſhewn) we may well think that God will be rather <hi>willing to ſhew his Wrath</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) this way, (if we could ſuppoſe there might be another,) becauſe this ſo falls in with, and agrees unto the rules and proportions of Juſtice fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are moſt near and ſacred to him.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60376:57"/> 2. The ſecond Aſſertion, That it is alſo requiſite, yea, neceſſary, (I ſpeak it, as in relation to Juſtice attaining its ends.) For all <hi>mediate Puniſhments</hi> executed by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being deficient, as unto that wherein the very Eſſence of this Puniſhment lies they all not reaching the Inwards of the Spirit of the Mind and Conſcience; and ſeeing that without God's wrath revealed therewith by God himſelf, all ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not compleat the Juſtice of God in a Puniſhment in any tolerable meaſure ſuitable. Then if Juſtice will have its perfect work, and bring its Suit againſt the Sinner unto the ultimate iſſue, it is requiſite God himſelf put his immediate hand to the execution. For otherwiſe this Work of Juſtice will not be perfect, (as yet every of his Works in their kind are ſaid to be). And ſo he ſhould not only fall ſhort of ſatisfying his Juſtice, but alſo by not doing that towards it which is in his power to do, and which he is Lord of, he ſhould not in any tolerable meaſure content it. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if we further conſider, that when all is done that can be done, this Puniſhment will not ariſe to a perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction (for the Creature's puniſhment will not afford it, and therefore it doth for ever ſuffer) but only unto what
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60376:57"/> may be had out of them towards it. I ſhut this Point up therefore with this, that <hi>If God be Judg Himſelf, he will do this work Himſelf,</hi> which none elſe can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form for him; and without which all elſe would be utterly imperfect and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. For, upon what hath been afore argued, I may ſay of all other Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Puniſhers (although ſet by God upon a Man) what the Apoſtle ſays of thoſe legal Ordinances (though inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God for his Worſhip) <hi>That they could not make the Service perfect, as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conſcience.</hi> So, nor all outward Torments, take them alone without God's Wrath accompanying them, they cannot make a perfect or compleat Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as <hi>pertaining to the Conſcience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And all this alſo ſhews one ſufficient reaſon of Difference, why earthly Kings and Judges leave the Execution of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Offenders wholly unto others: Becauſe they have no more Power, as in reſpect of Execution, to inflict a condign Puniſhment than other Men; but others can do it as exquiſitely, and their Juſtice be as fully ſatisfied thereby: but it is not ſo here. And for theſe cauſes God is ſo far from ſtaining his Glory thereby (which other Judges would eſteem to be ſo) as that it is the only way fully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60376:58"/> his Glory. And ſo much for that Argument drawn from ſatisfying of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Reaſon is drawn from ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Vengeance, or Avenging Wrath as againſt Enemies; which heightens Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Thus in many places in the Old and New Teſtament, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. In which laſt place, God is ſtiled both a Judg and an Avenger, <hi>[Judg</hi> and <hi>Avenge]</hi> ſay the Saints there. A Judg moſt commonly doth acts of Juſtice in the behalf of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but an Avenger is one that doth, or ſeeks Juſtice in his own Cauſe, and in his own behalf and Intereſt; therefore the next a-Kin, ſeeking the Life of a Murtherer, was termed an <hi>Avenger of Blood.</hi> Now God is more nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this, than any Creatures can be, in what may concern Vengeance in them, for what ever Injury. This is therefore <hi>poena vindictae,</hi> as of one enraged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked; Patience having been abuſed, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. and ſo is turned into Fury.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two properties of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, from whence I argue this, being put together.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that it is the property of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to vent it ſelf upon that which is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60376:58"/> principal in the Injury, and to make that the Veſſel of its Wrath, it will never be ſatisfied elſe. Now that is the Soul of Man, which is the chief ſeat and ſubject of the Corruption of Sin, the chief Cauſe of the Act proceeding from thence, and that in which the Guilt ariſing from both doth principally abide. The Body is but inſtrumental in what the Soul doth; yea, and in ſome, and the greateſt Sins, the Soul hath the ſole and immediate Hand. This Soul therefore which is the chiefeſt Veſſel of Sin, muſt be the chief Veſſel of Wrath. <hi>Indignation and Wrath upon every</hi> [Soul] <hi>of Man that doth evil,</hi> Rom. 2. 8. whereof this undeniable Inſtance is given by God, that the Soul is it that ſuffers for the whole Man until the Reſurrrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Inſtance of the Rich Man ſhews. And it muſt be no leſs an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Sufferer, although not the alone Sufferer; but much more, after the day of Judgment, unto Eternity.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing which Vengeance affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth is, that the perſon that wrought the Injury dye by the hand of himſelf, that is, the Avenger: <hi>It loves to do that work it ſelf.</hi> And this eſpecially holds good in this cauſe of God's, and ſeeing it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover glory to God by ſhewing Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; He <hi>comes to be glorified, rendring</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:60376:59"/> 
                        <hi>Vengeance from the glory of his Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I need not go about to form up any Argument from hence, for theſe two things, eſpecially the latter, do ſpeak home unto the Point: And being added unto what hath been ſpoken in the former Head of Juſtice, may be ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>There is a third thing, which, as I ſaid, both Divine Juſtice and Vengeance do conſpire in; and that is, the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that which is the principal Offendor (which is the Soul) it is the nature of Vengeance to work the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that it is ſet againſt. And in this caſe of Sin, God's Juſtice alſo doth the ſame: the demerit of Sin is ſuch, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth Vengeance to it. And therefore in both theſe places which are my Texts, Deſtruction is mentioned as the iſſue and product of this Revenge, and Wrath. So in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7. <hi>To render Vengeance</hi> on them, <hi>who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſtruction,</hi> and Rom. 9. 22. <hi>to make known the power of his Wrath on thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Wrath, fitted to Deſtruction.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed they ſhall be, though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of being, for they are to be Veſſels of Wrath, and therefore to be ſtill kept whole, in reſpect of being, elſe they could hold no Wrath: And that is another
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60376:59"/> property of Vengeance, to have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made ſenſible of its Miſery, and that his Enemy is even with him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God upholds their Being, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys their Souls in regard of well being. Now that is never till it be ſtript of every Comfort, and every corner of the Soul be filled with Miſery. For if any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be empty, it is not deſtroyed, it will not die.</p>
                     <p>Now this third or laſt thing, doth of it ſelf afford, at leaſt a Demonſtration, <hi>ab effectis,</hi> from the event and effects of this Puniſhment: <hi>That therefore it is God's immediate hand that inflicts</hi> this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Which Demonſtration is to be added, unto the former Reaſon, which was drawn from the Cauſes of it. For I argue, asking this Queſtion, What is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fill the Soul of Man, with good or evil? The Soul which was created in ſo large a Capacity, as to be filled with God, and with none but God himſelf; He only is able to fill the vaſt corners of it with either. Creatures like it ſelf may afflict and torment it much, eſpecially whilſt in the Body, ſo much, as to cauſe it to deſire Death, and a being out of the Body; but the Soul they are never able to deſtroy. The Soul is a Caſtle ſo ſtrong built, as it can bear the Aſſaults of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60376:60"/> all its fellow-Creatures, and ſuſtain it ſelf, and not ſink into Deſtruction. Nothing can deſtroy the well-being of the Soul but God's Power. For it is ſaid, <hi>They may kill the Body,</hi> but <hi>God only can kill the Soul.</hi> And elſe, according to that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body only, &amp;c.</hi> they were to be feared as God himſelf is, if they could kill the Soul, as God can do. For Chriſt ſays, <hi>God is therefore to be feared,</hi> and only to be feared, becauſe he <hi>can deſtroy both Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul.</hi> And he redoubleth it with an Emphaſis, <hi>Fear him, yea, I ſay unto you, Fear him, Luke</hi> 12. 5. Indeed one Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſays, <hi>Fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell,</hi> which expreſſeth no more but an act of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſentence and caſt into Hell, as the Judge doth into Priſon. Yet the other Evangeliſt puts it upon this, becauſe he is able <hi>to kill the Soul,</hi> and that only <hi>he is able to deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell.</hi> He ſays not barely to caſt into Hell as by way of Authority, but adds, <hi>kills and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys in Hell,</hi> when they are caſt thither: For God is both Judg and Avenger. And therefore if it be Deſtruction, 'tis evident He only can, and muſt do the execution. And therefore, in the Text, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8, 9. their being puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60376:60"/> Deſtruction, is attributed to the glory of his Power. Theſe are ſome of the Reaſons of this great Point.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. To begin where I left. Hereby it comes to paſs, that as the Souls of Men and other Spirits were immediately made and created by God (who is therefore in a peculiar reſpect, and with an oppoſite diſtinction to the Fathers of our Bodies, ſaid to be the Father of Spirits, and the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh) So, that their laſt termination or end, ſhould be,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60376:61"/> into and by his immediate Hands alſo: This makes up a congruous and ſuitable Diſpenſation. That look, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their firſt Being from him, likewiſe they ſhould return to him, as <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> ſpeaks, as to their ſole and immediate Author and Creator; and ſo receive from him, as a Father of Spirits their Portion at his immediat Hands. And Man's ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end, either way, is called their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 51. whether it be, in bleſſedneſs as their Inheritance out of his Love, or Miſery as the wages of their Sin. And thus hereby God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is made the end, and the beginning or <hi>terminus,</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of Souls: to whom be Glory for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thereby alſo, there comes to paſs an anſwerableneſs and a proportion held between the two conditions of Heaven and Hell: Which the Apoſtle ſeems to make the ultimate aim and determination of God's Counſels. Unto which all in this World are but preparations, as he calls them. (Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23.) for the ſhewing forth of his own immediate Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction: And that he might make known the riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:60376:61"/> 
                        <hi>Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto Glory?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thirdly alſo: It is ſaid that after that Chriſt the Judg of All, hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his Adminiſtration and Kingdom unto his Father, then God ſhould become all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. (not in reſpect of Being) that is, not as if the Being of all things ſhall return into God again, as ſome have wickedly dreamed: Or, that God's bleſſed Being, and the Creatures ſhould become one: that can never be. 'Tis a contradiction to ſay, a Creature made out of nothing ſhould come to be of it ſelf: and ſuch God in his Being is. But all in all, in reſpect of immediate Diſpenſation. And ſo look as to the Veſſels of Mercy, he will then be all in all, ſo that they ſhall not need the light of the Sun and the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that is, the comfort of any Creature, though all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Excellencies in the Spirit and quinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them ſhall be there) why ſhould it not be alſo meant that the ſame God (which makes up a Parallel, ſeeing Mens Sins deſerve it) ſhall be all in all, in Hell too, in a contrary way to the other?</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The first Head of Demonſtrations from this in General: That it is a falling into the Hands of God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FIrſt, let us take the main Doctrine it ſelf, as in the General it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here, <hi>That it is a falling into the Hands of God Himſelf,</hi> and not of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only: And a <hi>being puniſh'd from his Preſence, and the Glory of his Power,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, as 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. And then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and widen your apprehenſions, to take in how fearful this muſt be, which I ſhall demonſtrate, by a comparative Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, raiſed thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. If it were but a giving us up into the Hands of meer Creatures to afflict, and they aſſiſted by God, but with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary concurrence of his Power, which joins with, and upholds the Agency of all things in their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whether in comforting us or in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing of us: this is the loweſt degree
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60376:65"/> of ſuppoſition. And yet conſider how dreadful this Suppoſition would render to our Thoughts, ſuch a puniſhment to be: if God ſhould be but as the looker on, and withal the ſetter of them on: or (as in the Scripture phraſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 34.) <hi>but only deliver us up to theſe Tormentors.</hi> As when it is termed a <hi>being caſt into a Lake of Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> ſuppoſe it were a Lake of material corporeal Fire only, wherein thy Body is caſt; and thy Soul, no otherwiſe to ſuffer than by what the Spirits of that Body it is united to, and dwells in, is by that Fire made ſenſible of. And ſuppoſe withal, the Spirits thereof were kept up, in their utmoſt ſenſibleneſs, of what torment that Fire could inflict; and thy Body continually flaming, (as the Buſh in <hi>Exodus)</hi> and yet never burnt up, how terrible is it for Fleſh and Blood to think but this of it! Or, to uſe another compariſon, If a Man were bound Hand and Foot with his Mouth ſet open, and were caſt into a Pit, wherein, as in the Apoſtles Sheet, let down from Heaven, were all manner of <hi>Creeping things,</hi> Toads, Serpents of all ſorts, fiery Scorpions, Cockatrices, Vipers, Adders, Snakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Flies, Hornets, Lice, Piſmires and Frogs, <hi>&amp;c</hi> And that theſe ſhould bite and ſting thee, with exquiſite Pain and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60376:65"/> alſo creep in at thy Mouth, down into thy Inwards, gnaw and ſwell thee there. How did but one ſort of theſe Creatures, when ſent by God, afflict <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and all the <hi>Aegyptians?</hi> A Man in this caſe, ſhould endure not only the Pains mentioned, but beyond them the torture which Antipathy, cotrariety and natural abhorrency Works, which is of all other moſt exquiſite, and turns nature backward (as of <hi>Jordan</hi> it is ſaid) into a recoyl, and wreſteth it againſt it ſelf, and throws it off its hinges. I need not inſtance, how by this way of Antipathy, a Cock makes a Lion roar, a Mouſe the Elephant to tremble, a Serpent or a Toad, a Spider, ſets the whole of nature in Man into an inconſiſtency; a Man knows not how to bear up, ſuſtain himſelf, or be himſelf. But beſides what Pains or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, theſe, or any of theſe, can inflict.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Let us proceed in our Suppoſition a ſtep further. If God ſhould ſo far fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſt, as to ſet his Wiſdom a-work, and that only to find out and invent, what mixture of Torments from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would be moſt exquiſite of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As if a King (whoſe Wrath is compared to the roaring of a Lion, who yet ſets but others to Torment) ſhould
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60376:66"/> but order ten Men to invent Torments for one poor Man (as the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrants did.) Hence, <hi>Majus tormentum ſiculi non invenire Tyranni.</hi> And then conſider, for the exaggeration of this unto your Thoughts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the nature of Man is ſo fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is capable to recieve diſcomfort, as well as comfort from every Creature: the leaſt Creature hath a ſting in it, as well as Honey, unto ſomething or other, in Man's Nature, if it be applyed and turned againſt it. 2. God knows all the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in the Creatures Natures; as alſo it is ſaid, he knows our frame, and ſo there with the ſuitableneſs of Senſe in Man's Nature thereunto. Think then what Puniſhment from their mixture, can he invent and temper; and put all the Venoms, (the dregs) into one Cup, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks: And as by ſome leſſer proportion we may eſtimate this, by what thoſe that know the ſecrets of Nature can effect, above what other Men, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did. Now 3. Raiſe up your apprehenſions from theſe two ſteps of compariſon thus firſt laid: If, (as the Pſalmiſt ſays,) <hi>He that made the Eye, ſhall not he ſee?</hi> ſpeaking of that infinite Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience in God Himſelf, above what is in the Creatures: Say I then in this caſe, if
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60376:66"/> the Creatures, that God hath made, may thus be ſuppoſed able to work anguiſh to a Man, Dolour and Miſery: what then can God, the great God, that made all theſe himſelf, immediately inflict? As the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſlighteth the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and their Aſſiſtance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. 3. Thus, <hi>Their Horſes are Fleſh, not Spirit, and the Aegyptians that ride them are Men, and not God.</hi> So we may of all theſe Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtill ſay, theſe are but of what Creatures can do; who are Creatures, and not God; Fleſh and not Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That we may yet heighten the dreadfulneſs of this immediate Hand of God, let us make a third Suppoſition, beyond the former; that God not only ſhould uſe his ordinary concurrence with Creatures, but (as ſometimes he hath done) arm thoſe Creatures with his own Wrath, over and above the activity of their ordinary Sphere of Workings; heating that Sword of created Powers he ſtrikes with, red hot in the Furnace of his fiery Indignation: And ſo intending the power of Creatures beyond their Strength; yet ſtill ſo as to uſe them as the ſole Inſtruments of that anguiſh wrought: conveying his Anger with them but as at ſecond hand. And ſo, as the Man ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60376:67"/> afflicted, is ſenſible, not of the Stroke of the Creatures only, but of God, and his Wrath accompanying and ſeconding it, through them. This would be yet more dreadful than the former, and yet ſtill fall ſhort of what the Doctrine hath held forth, that <hi>Himſelf is the Avenger, and ſtrikes immediately.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. This latter is more dreadful to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than the former; yea, is not a bare ſuppoſition; for if God conveys his Wrath with the leaſt Affliction, and in his Providences fight againſt a Man, and the Heart is thereby made ſenſible of his Wrath therein: this, as it often falls out, ſo it uſeth wonderfully to enflame and rage in Man's Spirit: even as a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Arrow uſeth to do the Fleſh, which it ſelf alone would only pierce and wound, (but as it is an Arrow;) but if further dipp'd in Poyſon, or as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's compariſon is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. made a <hi>fiery Dart,</hi> it works a further Anguiſh and Torment. Now there is no Creature, but if armed with God's Wrath, or if it be but a Meſſenger, and a Repreſenter of God's Anger, but it is infinitely more dreadful than of it ſelf otherwiſe it is. What is leſs than the ſhaking of a Leaf, which ſeems it ſelf to tremble? But if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60376:67"/> God ſend faintneſs of Heart, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with it, and by it, into a Man's Heart, the very <hi>Sound of the ſhaking of a Leaf chaſeth them,</hi> Lev. 26. 36. Every Graſs-blade, burniſhed with God's Wrath, ſtrikes terror into the Heart, as that fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Cherub did into <hi>Adam</hi>'s. This is experimented in Men troubled in Mind, unto whom, <hi>Iratum<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> refert quaelibet herba Deum.</hi> Every Creature preſents an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God, and ſtrikes trembling of Heart into them. <hi>They fear where no fear is.</hi> The Light, which of all Creatures is the moſt amiable and pleaſanteſt, yet to a Spirit wounded the Beams thereof are dreadful; and when it is day, he wiſheth it were night, and that Darkneſs might for ever cover him; and why ſhould the Light ariſe, ſays he, to diſcloſe my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt my Maker? Thus <hi>Job,</hi> Job 4. 20. <hi>Wherefore is the Light given to him that is in miſery?</hi> Even as on the contrary, to a Soul God's Face ſhines on, every Creature ſtrikes up comfort and gladneſs into it. He hears the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (which made <hi>Caligula</hi> tremble,) <hi>'Tis my Father's Voice,</hi> ſays he: views the Stars; <hi>theſe are mine,</hi> ſaith he. The greateſt Afflictions to ſuch an one do turn into Joy, knowing he hath a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of Love in the Boſom of his Father
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60376:68"/> that ſent them. The perfect contrary is here.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This latter Suppoſal of God's arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creatures with his diſpleaſure, and conveying it by them, falls yet lower, and is leſs than God's immediate Wrath from himſelf; even as God's Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by Ordinances and Means, is a a far lower Diſpenſation than the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Communication thereof from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God's power, tho never ſo great, yet in working by and through an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, is abated, leſſened, ſtinted in working. You may have read and heard (perhaps) the compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God's Power and the Creatures, in reſpect of Torment, thus expreſſed: That the one is, but as if a Child ſhould ſtrike a Blow, in compariſon of a Giant: But to the caſe in hand, I have uſed to raiſe it thus: A Giant that can of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf give a great Blow immediately, if he yet ſhould take but a Straw to ſtrike withal, the Stroke would prove but ſmall; and yet it would be greater than if a Child ſhould ſtrike with it; Why? becauſe his Power is limited and enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Inſtrument he ſtrikes withal. Now what are all the Creatures, though in God's hand, but as Straws in a Giant's? And yet how terrible is his Wrath when
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60376:68"/> conveyed by them? I conclude this with alluſion to that Speech of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 12. 10. The weight of God's little Finger is heavier than that of the whole Creation: And if they be able, or God by them, to <hi>ſcourge us with Whips,</hi> then God himſelf immediately with <hi>Scorpions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus conſidered how the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediateneſs of God's working doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively exceed that of the Creatures, or of himſelf by the Creatures: In the</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourth place,</hi> Let us go on more ſadly, in a poſitive way, to conſider, What his <hi>immediate Power</hi> is; what the Strength of thoſe hands is which Men muſt fall into. And how may this amaze you? As it is ſaid of God's Wiſdom, <hi>There is no end of it, no ſearching of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> ſo nor of his Power. And how can I diſcover or unbare that Arm before you? I begin to do it thus: God had begun to enter into a Conteſt with <hi>Job,</hi> and touched him but with his little Finger; and <hi>Job</hi> ſoon felt him, and cries out: <hi>If I ſpeak of Strength,</hi> or think that way to grapple with him, <hi>He is ſtrong,</hi> Job 9. 19. If but his little Finger be ſo ſtrong, as <hi>Job</hi> found it, what is his Fiſt, which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> next ſets
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60376:69"/> forth his Strokes of his Wrath by? And what God himſelf there ſpeaks, againſt covetous and bloody Men, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 13, 14. do you apply to every Sin you live and go on in. Says God, <hi>I will ſtrike with my Fist at thy diſhonest Gain. And can thy Heart endure, or thy Hands be made ſtrong, in the Day in which I ſhall have to do with thee?</hi> Let every one that heareth or readeth this, who yet go on in their Sins, conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Am I able to ſtand it out, and encounter this God? And encounter him thou muſt, if thou goeſt on in thy Sins. Or can my Heart endure? ſay thou. The Apoſtle puts the very ſame conſideration upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when guilty of Idolatry. (And 'tis the ſame caſe of uncleanneſs, or any other known Sin) <hi>Do you provoke the Lord to Jealouſy? Are you ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 22. As if he had ſaid: Do you not conſider what a powerful God you have to do withal, and that immediately? Can you grapple with him, think you? or make your part good with him? Hear yet further, by what way it is that the Apoſtle ſets forth to us the Strength of God, and let us make a further eſtimate thereby, as to the matter in hand. The Apoſtle in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60376:69"/> the ſame Epiſtle, though upon another occaſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 25. had ſaid, That <hi>the Weakneſs of God is ſtronger than the Strength of Men.</hi> In which Speech, he evidently puts our thoughts upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a meaſure of what is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted more or leſs, ſtronger or weaker in God, in reſpect of the putting forth his Power by what the Scriptures do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of him, after the ſimilitude of Man, as in <hi>Job</hi> the compariſon is of his <hi>little Finger;</hi> and in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> of his <hi>Fist:</hi> whereof the one is weaker (in Man) and the other ſtronger. Now in Man, what is weaker than his Breath? which will ſcarce blow away a Straw (and his weakneſs is uſually expreſſed by this, that <hi>his Breath is in his Nostrils.)</hi> Now eſtimate the Strength of God according unto what is ſaid in the Scriptures of God, (and that as to this point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying us) after the manner of Men. <hi>By the very Breath of his Nostrils we are conſumed,</hi> Job 4. 9. His Power is ſuch, that he needs put forth no more (as it were) to deſtroy us. His very Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is enough. <hi>Job</hi> had in the ſame verſe, firſt ſaid, <hi>By the Blast of him we periſh:</hi> but becauſe a Blaſt imports ſome forcibleneſs, the utmoſt might of what is in a Man's Breath, and it is a Man's
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60376:70"/> putting forth his Breath with a more than ordinary violence; therefore by way of Diminution and Correction he adds, <hi>By the Breath of his Noſtrils;</hi> that is, (ſtill meaſuring it, as ſpoken, after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and manner of Men) by the moſt ordinary and weakeſt putting forth of his Power. And yet we ſee if he puts forth no more, he blows us to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when his intent is to deſtroy: And why? For of us the Scriptures uſe a compariſon ſuitable thereto, in ſaying that <hi>We are but as the Dust of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> Iſa. 40. 15. <hi>Yea, all the Nations</hi> (put all together) <hi>are but as the ſmall Duſt of the Ballance:</hi> As that little that is left in the Ballance, when what is weighed is taken forth, which is eaſily blown away with a Man's Breath. Again, yet lower, in Man; his Nod is of leſs force than his Breath: and yet, <hi>Lo, at the rebuke of his Countenance we periſh,</hi> Pſal. 80. 16. <hi>He can look on one that is proud, and abaſe him; and his Eye can caſt about Rage and Deſtruction,</hi> Job 40. 11, 12, 13. He had ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Haſt thou an Arm like God?</hi> He riſeth from the Power of his Nod, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power, unto the Power of his Arm: And ſo may we, from his Looks to his Breath, from that to his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60376:70"/> little Finger, from that to his Fiſt, from that to his Arm and Hands, in which his Strength is ſaid to lie, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 51. O think how dreadful then it muſt needs be, to <hi>fall into thoſe Hands,</hi> (as here in the Text,) into thoſe Hands, I ſay, that <hi>meaſure the Waters in the hollow of them,</hi> that <hi>ſpan the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> and at the ſame time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend alſo <hi>all the Dust of the Earth</hi> in one graſp, as one of us doth a little Pebble. And <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>Takes up the Iſles as a very little thing;</hi> as you would do Hazel-nut-ſhells out of a Pail of Water. Now for thee, a poor Graſhopper, to be taken into thoſe hands, and to be grip'd and cruſh'd, and ſqueezed with the might thereof. But the Scripture expreſſions go further yet, to have this God like a Mill-ſtone fall upon thee with his whole weight, which is Chriſt's compariſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 44. <hi>Thy Wrath lies hard upon me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Heman.</hi> You ſee in Summer little green Flies, creeping upon green leaves, which if a Man doth but touch, they die: ſuch a ſlight Creature art thou in compariſon to this God. Or further, (as <hi>Job</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is) that this Great and Mighty God ſhould run upon thee as a Mighty Giant, with his full force, the utmoſt of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60376:71"/> his Force, as a Man doth upon his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yet ſo <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 14. And in another place, the ſame <hi>Job,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>take thee about the Neck, and throttle thee.</hi> O what do we, poor <hi>Potſheards of the Earth, ſtriving with our Maker?</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 45. 9. Or, as Chriſt ſpake from Heaven, will Fleſh think to kick and ſpurn againſt ſuch Iron Pricks and Pikes, which run up into the Soul, whilſt it ſtrikes upon them.</p>
                     <p>And that we may yet further have a through ſenſibleneſs of our obnoxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and expoſedneſs to this Great God, let us withal conſider his <hi>abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> over us, as well as his <hi>Power.</hi> What an inconſiderable portion doth any one Soul (and every one is ſingly to deal with him for his own particular) bear unto this Infinity of Being and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to whom not one Nation, but all Nations; and not only all Nations that are now extant in the World, but that ever have been, or ſhall be, are counted <hi>as nothing,</hi> yea, <hi>leſs than nothing.</hi> What a little thing is this Iſland of ours, to the whole Body of Nations? And yet all <hi>Iſles are to him but a little thing,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks. Lord, think thou, what am I to Thee! or any Man! that thou
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60376:71"/> ſhouldeſt regard him! Yea, and being ſinful, why ſhould any Man (as he is of himſelf) think that God ſhould have any ſtick or demurr within him, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelf from deſtroying him every moment? For lo, even the greateſt of Men, that have been of greateſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Parts, (being Sinners) he hath in his diſtance and greatneſs laid them aſide, and regarded them not at all, <hi>Job</hi> 38. laſt: <hi>He regards not the Wiſe in Heart.</hi> What is all or any Excellency in thee to him?</p>
                     <p>There is therefore no way but to turn unto him, and ſeeing you muſt fall into his hands, prevent him by putting your ſelves into his hands. This great Arm of his may be held: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 5. <hi>Let them take hold of my Strength; Fury is not in me.</hi> There is an Arm alſo of another one, that is, Chriſt, who can deal with God for thee, and overcome him. <hi>[Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. <hi>To whom is the Arm of the Lord</hi> (ſo he termeth Chriſt) <hi>revealed?]</hi> Thus you have ſeen and heard ſomething of the Greatneſs of this God, and that but in general, as he is the Author of this Puniſhment, and thereby this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aggrandized unto us, and yet <hi>how little do we know of him?</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks.</p>

                     <p n="2">II. SUbjoin hereunto the conſideration of what is the eminent Subject of this Puniſhment, the <hi>Soul of Man;</hi> and that the Iſſue of this Puniſhment is no leſs than the <hi>Deſtruction of that Soul.</hi> And theſe two (which I join together) will afford further Reflections, to help us to conceive of the fearfulneſs of this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Conſideration hereof cometh in moſt pertinently next unto the foregoing, wherein the Power of the Agent was ſpoken to; but now in this the Capacity of the Subject or Patient, and the Receptivity thereof of Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from this Worker.</p>
                     <p>That the Soul is the immediate Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of this Wrath, that I ſpake to afore, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Fear not them that kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul: but rather</hi>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60376:72"/> 
                        <hi>fear him which is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</hi> The former part of which words evidently import: 1. That the Soul alone, and immediately in it ſelf, and not only in reſpect of what it ſuffers with or from the Bodies ſuffering, is the Subject of this Puniſhment, tho the Body alſo is: And 2. Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that it is the Deſtruction of both Body and Soul.</p>
                     <p>You know alſo the Rule, That the Meaſure of every Agent's working upon another muſt be taken from the Capacity of the Subject which the Impreſſion is made upon, as well as from the Power of the Agent that works. Fire works more fiercely upon Oil and Brimſtone, than upon Stones, or upon Duſt or Sands. You may diſcern this in the parts of your own Body: Rheum falling upon the Lungs doth not torture ſo, as falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tooth, a Joint, or Eye. How al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are the inward parts capable of more exquiſite Torment, as by the Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bred in them, than the outward are, by any Cuttings or Wounds?</p>
                     <p>Now the Soul of Man is capable of more exquiſite Impreſſions from God's hand, in that it is an intelligent Spirit, and in the ſubſtantial Faculties of it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulated to him, made in his Image,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60376:73"/> a Spirit as God is, that hath an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and other Faculties, to receive and take in from him what he is pleaſed to pour forth into it by them; and is accordingly more ſenſible thereof, than the Senſes of the Body are or can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be from Creatures. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nahum</hi> ſeems to have conſidered this, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. When ſetting out God's Wrath to Men in the effects of it, he firſt conſiders, how it works upon inanimate Creatures, that are at ſuch a diſtance (in reſpect of the kind of their being) from God's: <hi>It kindleth a Fire,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which maketh the Hills to melt, and the Eaath is burnt up at his preſence: yea, the World, and all that dwell therein,</hi> (which he will one day burn up with Fire.) Now from theſe the Prophet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and raiſeth up our thoughts. Doth he work thus upon inſenſible Creatures, as the Hills, and the Earth, and the whole World? Do the Elements melt with fervent heat? Are the Heavens ſhrivel'd up as a Scrole of Parchment afore him, by the violence of that Fire which he ſends forth? Conſider then, O conſider, ye Sons of Men, how will the Fire of his Wrath work upon your intellectual Souls? And as unto this Scope and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence with the former, I underſtand
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60376:73"/> what follows, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Who can ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Indignation? who can abide in the fierceneſs of his Anger?</hi> He here turneth his Speech, and applieth it to Men. For the Souls of Men being in their beings and kind nearer of kin to him, Spirits, as he is the great Spirit, and the Father of Spirits, which were made only for God, and to be filled with God, have accordingly a more intimate ſenſe of his Workings on them. And 'tis as if he had ſaid, If then he ſends forth ſuch a Fire as melts and diſſolves the Earth, Mountains of Iron or Braſs; how much more will it be able to melt Wax? And ſuch are Mens Souls to God, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to other Creatures. Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Soul, when he had thus to do with God, in the Day of his Anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 14. (that Pſalm was all made of him) <hi>My Heart is melted like Wax, it is melted in the midſt of my Bowels.</hi> And towards this Sence doth <hi>Sanctius</hi> ſeem to underſtand that Complaint of <hi>Job</hi>'s, uttered to his Friends concerning thoſe Terrors of God, which he felt within him, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 4, 11. verſes compared; <hi>Is my Strength the Strength of Stones? Or is my Fleſh,</hi> my Nature or Conſtitution, <hi>of Braſs,</hi> that I ſhould be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with this Indignation of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60376:74"/> Almighty? Stones and Braſs have no ſenſe in them, (or but a dull ſenſe, if their Opinion ſhould hold true, <hi>de ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu rerum,)</hi> they have no Blood nor Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to make them ſenſible of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of God's Anger he had ſpoken of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Ay, but <hi>Job</hi> meaneth to ſay, I have a Soul made of other Metal, ſuited to God, the great Spirit, whoſe Arrows I feel, which is exquiſitely ſenſible of all his Actings. Take the Statue of a Man made of Braſs, or cut out of Stone, and ſlaſh and cut him, and he feels it not; but cut the ſame Limbs that anſwer to theſe in a living Man, made of Fleſh and Blood, with the ſame knife, and what Torture is it? You may ſee this, and aggravate it to your ſelves, by what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Spirits to this great Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as Angels and Devils, can work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man's Soul, that is a Spirit like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being yet inferior to them. When <hi>Saul</hi> had but one evil Spirit ſent from the Lord, how diſtracted and terrified was he, tho in the midſt of the enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Kingdom? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 14. Alſo that great Apoſtle, that had his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit fortified, as having been newly feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Joys of Heaven, and that not as at a diſtance only, but as a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that ſtood by, preſent there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60376:74"/> Yet one Angel, <hi>Satan buffeting him,</hi> he was ſo diſturbed and put to it, as he knew not what to do, or how to bear it: only God told him, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Well, but do Mens Souls in Hell <hi>fight with Fleſh and Blood,</hi> yea, or <hi>with Principalities and Powers</hi> chiefly? No, that is but whilſt they are the <hi>Rulers of this World,</hi> as there 'tis added. And yet if theſe Spirits have ſuch power over our Spirits to buffet and terrify them; what hath God the Father of them?</p>
                     <p>Again, conſider how the Soul is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more Joys and Sorrows, than the Bodily Senſes are, and this by how much it doth exceed them in its Eminency and Capacity. The Soul is able to drink up all the Pleaſures the whole Creation can afford the Bodily Senſes, or they bring in: to drink them up (I ſay) even at one Draught, and yet would in the midſt of it, ſtill cry, <hi>Give, Give.</hi> Now as it is in the Body of a Man, look whatever part is capable of more Pleaſure, it is alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable more of Pains: So the Soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably; look how capable it is of greater Joys (as it is from God) it is as much of Sorrows alſo, unto the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and intention of them.</p>
                     <p>Add II. As to this Point, That as the Soul is thus vaſtly capable of more Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60376:75"/> and Anguiſh; So further, that theſe Souls to be puniſht are filled with Sin, and in that reſpect termed <hi>Veſſels of Wrath fitted to Deſtruction, Rom.</hi> 9. 22. Take a Barrel of Wood; and of it ſelf it will burn as it is Wood: but if withal it be Pitcht within, and full of Tar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Matter, it will burn more rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. Of unfruitful Branches, Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing from Chriſt, it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> 15. 6. <hi>That they are caſt into the Fire, and they are burned,</hi> that is, they burn to purpoſe; make a mighty Fire. That Clauſe <hi>[And they are burned]</hi> is added by way of Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſis or Emphaſis, elſe it needed not. We ſee when Sins were but laid upon Chriſt by Imputation, who in himſelf was ſeparate from Sinners, and had no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Sin, how yet the Anger of God againſt Sin dealt with him, as undertaking to be a Surety for Sin. And <hi>can you drink,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>the Cup that I am to drink of,</hi> that is, ſo as to bear it and not be overcome with it? Now in <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 31. you may ſee, how Chriſt infers from his Sufferings, as being the Sufferings of one who had not been himſelf perſonally guilty of Sin, what therefore, with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, thoſe in whom Sin is inherent, muſt expect. <hi>Weep for your ſelves</hi> (ſays he) <hi>for if they do thoſe things to the green</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:60376:75"/> 
                        <hi>Tree, what will be done in the Dry?</hi> that is, who are fit combuſtible Matter for the Fire; and as the Prophet ſays, <hi>are as Stubble fully dry, Nahum.</hi> 1. 10. And of the terribleneſs of God's Anger, he had afore diſcourſed (as was even now obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) in all that Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Again III. In the Soul, ſome Faculties are more capable of Anguiſh from his Wrath than other; even as in the Body ſome Parts are more of Pain. If a Man would avoid a ſcalding drop to be let fall upon any Part, of all other he would fence his Eye. You ſee how a Mote, a Flie troubleth it: a ſcalding drop of Oyl would much more. So it is in the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul. You read there is the <hi>Spirit of the Mind, Eph.</hi> 4. 23. Now God will wound, even that, and aims at it, in this Puniſhment. <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon)</hi> If a Man's Fleſh be torn and cut, he may yet bear up himſelf, but if his Bones be broken, <hi>who can ſtand?</hi> Now the immediate Stroaks of God are ſo compared by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> as unto the breaking of the Bones, in compariſon of other dealings of God with, and Inflictions from God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60376:76"/>
                     <p> The next thing which I mention but as an Appendix to this Head, is, that it is the Deſtruction of the Soul. So, Chriſt and the Apoſtle again and again. <hi>They are ſaid to be loſt:</hi> and though Men may <hi>Metaphyſically</hi> diſpute, that it is better to Be, though in Hell, than not to Be: Yet Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>it were better not to have been born.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more as to this Head, than what the Apoſtle expreſſeth this by, in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. in ſaying, <hi>[That Men are drowned in Perdition and Deſtruction]</hi> one would think, for him to have expreſſed Death and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it might have been enough to have ſaid, that a Man were drown'd, or ſunk down to the bottom of Waters, or the like Materials that would ſuffocate a Man: But to ſay he is <hi>drowned in Perdition</hi> it ſelf, or that <hi>Perdition and Deſtruction</hi> are the Pit, the Lake, he is plunged into; what can be ſaid beyond it? And yet here, he is not content with one ſingle Word to expreſs that by neither, as to have ſaid <hi>drowned in Perdition,</hi> but muſt double it: and add another Word <hi>[De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction]</hi> alſo. <hi>Deſtroyed,</hi> therefore <hi>over, and over: Drowned over Head and Ears,</hi> as we ſay, and all that is in them, <hi>drowned</hi> and ſunk into <hi>Perdition;</hi> the whole Soul:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60376:76"/> yea, the whole Man. No part above Water. <hi>Deſtroyed</hi> with a double <hi>Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> both for Object double, and alſo for the Subject of it, both Body and Soul: So Chriſt ſays.</p>

                           <hi>A third Head, of Demonſtrations: drawn from the final Cauſes formerly mentioned: As</hi> 1. <hi>The Glory of God.</hi> 2. <hi>The Manifeſtation of his Power.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe third Head, that affords matter of Exaggeration to our Thoughts, whereby to infer the fearfulneſs of this Puniſhment, is taken from the Ends, or Final Cauſes mentioned in that firſt Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Ends, I ſay, which God hath in, and is provoked by, unto this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as I then ſingly argued from each of them the immediateneſs of God's Hand therein; ſo now I ſhall from each of the ſame, The dreadfulneſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. There were three Attributes of God in Special, and his Glory in Common, which God aimeth at the Manifeſtation of, in this ultimate Guerdon or Reward for Sin. 1. The Manifeſtation of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60376:77"/> Glory (that's in Common;) then parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, 1. Of his Power. 2. The ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his Juſtice. 3. Of his Wrath. The Scriptures I then had recourſe to, do ſpecify all theſe. I ſhall ſpeak to theſe in this Section, and to the other in the following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In General, that he aimeth at his Glory in it (which is God's general aim, and is common to theſe and all other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes) is evident. His Glory, (as it is to be manifeſted to us) is but the reſult or ſhine of all or any of his Attributes manifeſted. In that place of <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf,</hi> that is, <hi>for his Glory</hi> (for that is himſelf: <hi>My Glory I will not give to another)</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>yea even the wicked for the day of evil.</hi> The <hi>day of evil</hi> there is the day of <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> the Wicked themſelves alſo making and preparing themſelves by Sin thereto; but ſo as thereupon God manifeſts his Glory upon them, as well as upon all things elſe; which he hath made in their ſeveral ſeaſons and kinds. And <hi>Solomon</hi> doth mention this of Puniſhment as one Eminent Inſtance of all things elſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that are for his Glory, and which will be ordered then by him, thereunto in a ſpecial manner: And becauſe (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60376:77"/> ſo great an evil) Men might think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; Yea, but ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> God ſeeks and will have a Glory out of this Puniſhment, as well as out of all things elſe; of which ye all acknowledg, that God made them for himſelf. And ſo in that 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. They are ſaid to be <hi>puniſht from the Glory of his Power,</hi> that is, from his Power, glorifying himſelf on them, as I afore expounded it. And as, it is for the Glory of this his Power, ſo by the ſame reaſon of all, or any of thoſe other Attributes, he is pleaſed to put forth therein.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall premiſe two <hi>Maxims,</hi> from whence fore-laid the Inference, for the dreadfulneſs of this will more readily riſe, in an infinite height, unto our more ſerious and ſober Apprehenſiions.</p>
                     <p>The firſt: <hi>That all things which God doth for his own Glory, he will perform them like himſelf,</hi> that is, like God: and ſo make the utmoſt of every thing, that that ſubject Matter, whatever it be, will afford of Glory to him. This Rule is aſcertained to us, as from the Nature of God; ſo from that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. where he condemns the <hi>Gentiles, that they glorified him not as God,</hi> that is, in ſuch a manner as was worthy of him; they came not up to that height
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60376:78"/> of Glory, ſo great a God muſt have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him from Creatures. Now if it be the Sin of Creatures, that they fall ſhort <hi>in glorifying God as God;</hi> then be aſſured that if God himſelf undertakes and profeſſeth to do a thing for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he will, in the whole of it, and iſſue thereof, either <hi>glorify himſelf as God,</hi> or never begin to eſſay or meddle with it, but would have let it alone, for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From hence, take this alſo along with you, to carry it in your view; through each particular that follows: <hi>That then, if God ſeeks to glorify himſelf in a way of Puniſhment, that Puniſhment muſt be anſwerably great and proportioned</hi> to raiſe up a Glory unto God, ſuch as ſhall <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him, As God,</hi> in that way. For it is the Puniſhment or the Judgment it ſelf which he executes (as the Pſalmiſt ſays) out of which this Glory muſt ſpring. <hi>This Puniſhment, as it is a Puniſhment,</hi> is that, <hi>wherein God will be glorified as God.</hi> That is, it is the Soil which this Crop of his Glory is to grow up out of, and the Crop or Harveſt of Glory can be but what the fertility of that Soil, as ſuch, affords: Theſe things in general fore-laid.</p>
                     <p>Now, 3. The greatneſs or vaſt comings in of that Glory, God reckons upon from
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60376:78"/> this, may riſe up in your view, by theſe Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Had it not been that in compariſon of other works of his, an infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Revenue of Glory would have ariſen unto him from this, <hi>God would never have ſet his Heart or Hand to this work of all other:</hi> I ſay it again, <hi>He would never have ſet his Hand to this work of all other.</hi> For as he is Creator, he hath a love to all, and hates nothing that he hath made, he loves no ſuch bloody work for it ſelf; nor would have ever embrued his Hands in the Deſtruction of his Creature, had it not been for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of Glory; and as being juſtly provoked thereto, it becometh a juſt Prize, on that Hand preſented to him: which he will be ſure withal to manage and perform with the utmoſt Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is certain, that this is to him <hi>opus alienum, a work ſtrange to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks. He does not naturally, no nor willingly (ſays the <hi>Lamentations) afflict,</hi> or <hi>grieve the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men. Lament.</hi> 3. 33. Mens Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings and Cavils hereabout did put him long ſince to his Oath, and he hath clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf by Oath in <hi>Ezekiel, As I live, I will not the Death of a Sinner,</hi> that is not ſimply, as if I delighted in it for it ſelf,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60376:79"/> as a God that is cruel; (which was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) and therefore I ſay peremptorily it muſt be an infinite maſs of Glory, after much long-ſuffering and impenitency of Men, that moves him to it. And if ſo, then according to the Principles even now mentioned, do you that are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners look to it, for <hi>ex veſtro ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> (I allude to <hi>Job</hi>'s Speech, <hi>Skin for Skin) out of the Blood of your Souls,</hi> and their Deſtruction, ſhall this Tribute and Tax of Glory be raiſed, according unto what your ſinfulneſs ſhall be found to have been. And oh then, do you col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect how fearful it is like to be! View it in a contrary, and indeed though an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance far tranſcending the Proportion of this, yet in reſpect of holding ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God's proceeding in this, will conduce to heighten our Thoughts about this. It is a Conſideration that helps our Faith (and 'tis a great one) that for God to <hi>deliver up his own Son</hi> to Death, and for himſelf to <hi>bruiſe him,</hi> (you have it all in a ſhort Saying, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him)</hi> and that this ſhould be the Object of his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, there muſt have been ſome incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible vaſt deſign of Glory to accrue there-from, to be attained by doing it; ſome high End and far tranſcending De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60376:79"/> that was to be the Iſſue and Product of it. Which as you know was the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Mercy and Love in the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men; <hi>Glory to God on High, Good Will to Men.</hi> And this is as great an Evidence and Argument to our Faith, that God is reſolved to ſave Sinners, as can be given. For what hath been thus done to Chriſt is paſt recalling; not to be recompenſed any other way than by <hi>ſaving many by the Knowledg of him,</hi> as God there ſpeaks. Now as this Inſtance of the higheſt kind ſerves to evidence this thing to us, ſo though in a far leſſer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, you may take ſomewhat alike Illuſtration, at leaſt, in the Point in Hand; That certainly it muſt be a great ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing maſs of Glory that will come in unto him by this Puniſhment for Sin, which ſhould any way gain him to be ſo much as willing to it, againſt which, otherwiſe he hath ſo much in his own Nature; who had it withal in his abſolute Power to have given effectual Grace to all, as well as to ſome; which latter all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he hath done. Even as it was in his Power to have ſaved the World without Chriſt's Death, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 36. Oh! ye Sons of Men, know and underſtand your God, and be moved thereby to turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and the more by this, that it

                     <p n="2">2. Conſider herewith, how that he hath reſerved this, as his laſt work, in that other World: when this World ſhall come to be folded up as a Garment; and a final concluſion be put to all theſe other Diſpenſations and Works of Glory that are now on Foot. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> told us that he hath <hi>made the wicked for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for the day of evil;</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> alſo tells us, <hi>That the Wicked is reſerved to the day of Destruction, and ſhall be brought forth at</hi> (or <hi>to) the day of Wrath:</hi> [Reſerved] by God, till after all his other works of wonder are ended and gone, then to be brought forth as a Trophie of his Glory. Both themſelves and all their Sins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till then, and laid up amongſt God's Treaſures, to be then made publick. The Salvation of his Elect, and the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wicked, are the laſt and only
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60376:81"/> Works that then remain, and do remain, and are purpoſely kept unto that time, when he means to ſhew himſelf to be God indeed; and to make all Men and Angels know that he is God. It is an Argument of the fearfulneſs of that Puniſhment the Devils ſhall undergoe, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>That he hath reſerved them in everlaſting Chains unto the Judgment of the great day.</hi> It is a certain Rule, <hi>that God's latter works do still exceed and put down the former:</hi> So far, as the former <hi>ſhall not in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be remembred, Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 16. When God would make his Apoſtles (as to this World) the greateſt ſpectacle of Miſery that (excepting what he made his own Son, who was the <hi>firſt-born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Bretbren)</hi> he ever put upon Saints, Prophets or Martyrs, that had preceeded and were afore them. How doth the Apoſtle expreſs his Deſign in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>I think</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles [last] as it were Men appointed to Death, for we are made a Spectacle unto the World, and to Angels, and to Men.</hi> Alluding to thoſe Gladiators, brought up laſt upon the Stage, as a Spectacle to the People. The thing I cite it for, is, that the greateſt work in that kind, he appointed to be at laſt: As alſo, was that which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60376:82"/> preceded it, <hi>the coming of his Son</hi> in the <hi>laſt days.</hi> And but this of puniſhing the Wicked is his laſt, and very laſt, of all that he will do for ever.</p>
                     <p>Eſpecially let us withal, 3. Conſider beſides, how all his Actings and Works whereby to glorify himſelf for ever, ſhall be reduced and contracted to theſe two. He gives over all other of Providence, and Spiritual Diſpenſations by Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſets down and betakes himſelf to theſe two alone. God hath nothing elſe to do in the other World. And he hath no other revenue of manifeſted Glory that remains extant; he lives and reigns eternally in or upon theſe two: And yet this is then, when he is reſolved, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to be glorious. And yet all is but what comes out of theſe two Works, the Salvation of the Elect, and Deſtruction of the Wicked.</p>
                     <p>Again, 4. Conſider theſe two are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Works, and unvarying; <hi>and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhadow of turning:</hi> In this World he makes a variety and enterchange of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; which are exerciſed in ſuch Works as he ſometimes takes up, and then lays down again, at Pleaſure; he <hi>ſets one thing againſt another</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day and Age produceth a Variety and Alteration. And this is, becauſe his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60376:82"/> that appeareth but imperfectly in ſome one (as in this and that particular) may have an additional perfection in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that ſo, all that Variety, may like ſmall pieces in Tapeſtry, make that piece of Work compleat. And yet we ſee how in this Mixture, and often, but in ſome one ſingle Work or Piece, wrought and done but once, how much of God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appears to the wonderment of Men and Angels. Whereas now this laſt work of puniſhing Wicked Men (as likewiſe that other of Salvation) are but as one continued Diſpenſation of one Woof, and uniform for ever, without Change, Variety or Interruption. The whole ſtream of God's Activity contracts it ſelf unto, and runs in theſe two Channels and no more, <hi>in omne volubilis aevum:</hi> And how ſtrong muſt you needs ſuppoſe theſe two Streams, each of them to be? when as the Manifeſtation of the Deity, doth now run ſo ſtrongly in a thouſand Rivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. This in General, from the Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his Glory.</p>
                     <p>I named three Attributes in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which God doth more eminently ſhew forth in this great, and laſt Work of His. 1. His Power. 2. Juſtice. 3. Avenging Wrath, to the end to gain
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60376:83"/> a Glory to Himſelf out of all theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His <hi>Power:</hi> That you have in two Places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Power known?</hi> His Power you ſee, is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſtinct from his Wrath, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it will provoke to be the Power of his Wrath; But I ſhall diſtinctly ſpeak of it. You have it alſo mentioned as that Attribute which ſhall be moſt glorified hereby, in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Who ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Deſtruction from the Glory of his Power.</hi> I afore ſpake ſome things of the <hi>greatneſs of God's Power,</hi> as in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this Puniſhment, in ſhewing how fearful it is to fall into the Hands of God, in the firſt Head of Demonſtration in this Section, I ſhall only here add,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This general Rule concerning it, <hi>That the drawing forth of Power or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity by God in any work, is ſtill, but what is proportionable and anſwerable to the work:</hi> that is, the effect ſhall be anſwerable in greatneſs to the Power that is ſaid to be put forth. It is certain, God over-acts nothing. Now the Effect, wherein this Power of his is put forth, is here ſaid to be Deſtruction. And therefore that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction muſt be conceived proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Power, that is ſaid to be exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There was never Work which God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60376:83"/> ever did, wherein he profeſſed to ſhew forth a tranſcendency of Power, or of any other Attribute, but it was wonderful and glorious in its kind. All his Attributes are himſelf, and ſo as great as himſelf. This viſible World, in its kind, what a glorious Building is it? Conſiſting of Heaven and Earth: and to what end was it that he profeſſed he made it? You have it <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>That by the Creation of the World, might be underſtood his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> And if He that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and raiſed up ſuch Beings out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſhall profeſs yet further, to make his Power known, and will uſe that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and put it forth in Deſtroying, to ſhew forth the Glory of it, How great will that Deſtruction be? which muſt bear a Proportion to ſuch a Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That after God hath in ſo great and ſo various Works preceeding this, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently (as we might think) ſhewn himſelf God, in point of Power, or what a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful God he is; that yet after all as if in all theſe he had not given ſo full Proof or Demonſtration of Power, and as not ſatisfyed with all the former, as not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: he ſhould be after all, willing, as the Apoſtle ſays here at laſt, to begin a new Work, which ſhould make the Ears of the whole Creation tingle, on purpoſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60376:84"/> to make his Power known! This is it ſwallows up my Thoughts into Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, knowing both, that according to the rule afore given, His laſt Works or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſhew forth any Attribute, muſt infinitely exceed the former, that ſerved to the making known thereof. And that again puts a new amazement into my Thoughts, to think how, or wherein ſo much a greater proportion of Power ſhould be ſpent. If it were barely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate, and bring the Creature to its firſt Nothing, there needs not an extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Power; it were but <hi>withdrawing that Word of his Power</hi> that holds up, and bears up all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and theſe, as all, would fall to nothing. But over and above, you read here, of ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as draws out his Power poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and makes his Power known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh. Specially, when again I conſider as to this Particular, that to deſtroy the well being of any thing, is in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Experience, of us Creatures, more eaſy than to give Being. A Man that cannot make alive the leaſt of Creatures, not the leaſt Fly or Flea, can yet with an eaſy touch deſtroy them. I hinted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">§. 1. ch. 3. p. 188.</note> ſome reſpects, wherein this Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might exceed, in reſpect of Power concurring to it, that of the Creation.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60376:84"/> In the Creation there was but a ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Power, namely, of or meerly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up out of Nothing: But in this a double. For the Wrath of God exerted in the fierceneſs of it, hath a tendency to bring, and would if no other Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened, bring the Sinner unto nothing; as that ſpeech of <hi>Jeremy</hi> doth imply, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>me not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing;</hi> as alſo that of <hi>Nahum, Who can ſtand in the fierceneſs of his Anger?</hi> ſo as under this his preſſure of the Creature unto nothing, for God to uphold that Creature, in Being, is equivalent unto a continual educing it out of nothing again. Oh what Deſtruction muſt that then be in the Execution of it, in which God will poſitively put forth more Power than in Creating! and thereby after all other works of Power ſhewn, get himſelf the name among the whole Creation, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a powerful God indeed: But of this Deſtruction more hereafter. Thus much for that of Power.</p>

And indeed God's Power herein is not put forth ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply out of Soveraignty, or for it ſelf, but is drawn out by Juſtice and Wrath, to execute what they are provoked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. I afore gave this as one reaſon why God himſelf muſt execute this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe elſe the Puniſhment will not come up to ſatisfy his Juſtice. But now I make uſe of the ſame, to infer the Dreadfulneſs thereof: That it is the falling into the hands, as of a potent God, ſo of a juſt God recompencing for Sin, and extending his mighty Power
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60376:85"/> to inflict a Puniſhment, which ſhould in Juſtice hold proportion with the deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sin, that ſo the exactneſs of his Juſtice might appear.</p>
                     <p>Now to heighten our Apprehenſions of the Dreadfulneſs of this Puniſhment, from this particular: Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Infinite Demerit of Sin. Which is not enough known or conſidered by the miſerable Subjects thereof; becauſe indeed God himſelf, in his Holineſs, and in his Greatneſs, is not known by them. Now becauſe Men will not otherwiſe know, nor be ſenſible of Sin, in the Spiritual evil of it, againſt God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that God is put upon it, thus to make Men know it; and what God himſelf is, for Men to ſin againſt him, by ſuch dreadful Effects, as in Juſtice ſhall hold proportion with their Sin, and the Deſert thereof. And God profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, he will herein be exact, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2. So, <hi>As every Tranſgreſſion ſhall receive [a juſt Recompence] of Reward.</hi> Not ſuch or ſuch Sins, ſome few more eminent Sins only, but <hi>[every Tranſgreſſion]</hi> ſhall have a Reward proportionate. <hi>He that is the Judg of all the World, ſhall not he be exact?</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Yes, in this ultimate Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will be ſure to be, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60376:86"/> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>To lay Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plummet.</hi> As Carpenters do, when they would fit things one to another, and make things uniform and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ſquare them adequately, to an hairs breadth, as we ſay. And thus will God do in Judging. He will bring his Line and his Plummet, take meaſure of the hainouſneſs of every Sin, and mete a Puniſhment adequate thereto. And if ſo, then this Puniſhment how dreadful will it be? <hi>If thou wilt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to mark what is done amiſs, who will be able to ſtand?</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt. The <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3.</note> Hainouſneſs of Sin is meaſured by the Greatneſs of that Glory whereof it is the debaſement; and that Debaſement done to him, further meaſured by this, that it is, by ſo mean things, as we Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to God. And ſo is eſtimated by the worth of that Perſon againſt whom it it is committed, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could by no other means be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, but by the debaſement and empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of as great a Glory, due to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son of God, appearing in our Nature, as one Perſon therewith. <hi>Sin,</hi> the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>is above meaſure ſinful.</hi> And hence accordingly this Puniſhment is eſtimated to be <hi>above</hi>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60376:86"/> 
                        <hi>meaſure fearful.</hi> Thus <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 11. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 7, 8. God putting this very difference between his puniſhing godly Men, his own Children, and his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked Men: <hi>Hath he ſmitten him, as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him?</hi> No; for he puts this difference in the <hi>8th ver. He ſmites his own in meaſure.</hi> You may then take the Compaſs, the Magnitude, and Depth of it by this; that therefore oppoſitely his Puniſhing the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all meaſure. Sin is the Creatures proper work, and Puniſhment is God's work. <hi>[Vengeance belongeth unto me,]</hi> ſays the Text; he challengeth it as his. Now it is certain, God will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as perfect and as exact in his Work, as Man and Satan have been in theirs; he will not be exceeded or out-gone by them. <hi>The Lord is known,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>by the Judgment that he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,</hi> Pſal. 9. 16. If the Creature be ſo wicked, as to bring forth ſo hainous an Evil <hi>(in genere moris)</hi> as Sin is, which is <hi>Malum Catholicum</hi> [a Catholick Evil] and accordingly hath the Name of all Evil given it, as virtually and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently containing all that God or Man calls <hi>Evil;</hi> then be aſſured, that God, who is ſo juſt, will be as ſure to bring forth, by way of return upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60376:87"/> a Puniſhment, that ſhall be <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere Poenae,</hi> in it's kind, <hi>Malum Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> an univerſal Evil alſo. And ſuch <hi>Ezekiel</hi> terms it, ſpeaking of the Evil of Puniſhment: <hi>It is an Evil, and an only Evil,</hi> Ezek. 7. 5. That is, ſuch an Evil as ſhall be nothing but evil, and that ſhall contain the Spirit, the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of all Evil in it. Therefore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 8. <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a Cup, and it is full of Mixture.</hi> As if an Artiſt, that knows the Nature of all Simples, ſhould temper a Cup, that is full of all ſorts of Poyſons, and which is a Compound of the bittereſt, loathſomeſt Ingredients this Earth puts forth. Even thus hath God ſtrained the quinteſſence of all Evils into one Cup; and it follows there, <hi>The Wicked of the Earth must drink the dregs of it.</hi> Which Phraſe alſo argues ſuch a Mixture as this we ſpeak of; the bittereſt of all is at the bottom; and 'tis Eternity to the bottom, and they muſt not, nor ſhall not leave a drop, but ſuck out the <hi>Dregs,</hi> as the Prophet's Phraſe is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 34. Thou haſt a <hi>Cup of Abomination,</hi> and when thou haſt <hi>fill'd up thy meaſure,</hi> then will God take meaſure of thy Cup, and fill the ſame proportion of Dregs and Mixture to thee, in a Cup of his tempering.</p>

                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:60376:87"/> 2. Conſider, that in the manifeſtation of this Attribute of Juſtice, there muſt of all other (next unto that of Mercy) be a more ſpecial Glory intended and deſigned by God himſelf, unto which this Puniſhment muſt bear an eminent proportion, as being the Matter wherein it appears. I ſaid afore, that if God profeſſed to manifeſt any Attribute of his whatever, it ſtill hath been done in ſuch Effects of Wonder, as all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is ſet admiring of. Now of all other Attributes, theſe two of Juſtice and Mercy are the prime, which he ſets the greateſt value upon the manifeſtation of. And therefore ſtill look how they are more eminent, or by how much the more eminently he intends to manifeſt them above other Attributes; by ſo much muſt the Effects, in and by which he manifeſteth them, exceed and excell all other Works.</p>
                     <p>Now that theſe are the brighteſt Jewels in that Crown of his Glory, and which he intends moſt to embeliſh, may be ſeen in this: 1. That he hath choſen the choiceſt and moſt excellent of his Creatures, as the Stuff or Materials in which to ſet theſe forth; namely, <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and Chriſt himſelf the Head of all. That look as curious Engravers,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60376:88"/> when they would ſhew their beſt Art, and chiefeſt Workmanſhip, they cull out the choiceſt Materials, as either precious Stones, Cedar, or Marble, to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo Embroiderers, the fineſt Stuff or Cloth for the Ground-work, they would embroider Gold or Pearls upon: Thus hath God ſingled forth Angels and Men, the chief of, and more noble Creatures (in the Stuff they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of) than the reſt of his whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Power and Wiſdom is ſeen in other Creatures, but Vindicative Juſtice, as alſo Grace and ſaving Mercy, only on Men and Angels. And, 2. Although he hath ſhewn forth more of Wiſdom and Power in the Frame and Fabrick of Men and Angels, than in the whole of Heaven and Earth; yet ſtill, comparatively, more of Juſtice and Mercy in theſe two, than that all, or any of the other Attributes, ſhewn forth in and upon them, comes unto. Whereof this is ſufficient evidence, that they have the Name of <hi>Veſſels of Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Veſſels of Wrath,</hi> Rom. 9. You read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that they are termed <hi>Veſſels of Power,</hi> or <hi>Veſſels of Wiſdom:</hi> which is a Token that they are fill'd with theſe, in that they carry away the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (which is uſually <hi>à Principaliori,)</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:60376:88"/> as if no Attributes elſe in compariſon ſeemed to appear: and yet how much of Power and Wiſdom is ſeen in the Fabrick of Man, <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>I am wonderfully</hi> or <hi>fearfully made.</hi> So then, thoſe that ſhall prove to be the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Veſſels of this his Wrath and Juſtice, ſhall be ſo fill'd with a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby this Juſtice is made known, as ſhall deſervedly bear the Name of Wrath and Judgment engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon it, of all other Attributes. <hi>The Day in which he will judg the World, Acts</hi> 17. 31. is elſewhere called, the Day of Deſtruction, the Day of Wrath, the Day of Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It beareth its Denomination from this very Work we ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>And further, conſider how he hath given out afore-hand, almoſt ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before, concerning this Work, above all Works elſe, and hath poſted it upon <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Pillars, (you know the Tradition I allude to) as you uſe to do Citations, <hi>Jude</hi> 14, 15. or as you do <hi>indicere diem,</hi> ſet a Day for the moſt ſolemn Works. <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> propheſied hereof, ſaying, <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgment upon all,</hi> &amp;c. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60376:89"/> and beſides, God ſpeaks of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to have been all along made by him, during the time of this World, againſt that Day. The Perſons are a fitting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. The Puniſhment a preparing; <hi>prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> even from their very firſt Fall. Now certainly God would never raiſe up in us, by ſuch words given out by himſelf, ſo great expectations, if the Reality, the Execution, the Thing it ſelf, ſhould not anſwer to all theſe. Yea, after all his other Works of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der finiſhed and perfected, he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to come on purpoſe to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And in what? as well in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Vengeance in the Deſtruction of Wicked Men, as in the glorifying his Saints, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence Tribulation to them that trouble you: And to you that are troubled, Reſt with us. When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſh'd with everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power: When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints,</hi>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60376:89"/> 
                        <hi>and to be admired in all them that believe, in that day.</hi> He carries on the glorifying himſelf, and of his Power, in the one, as well as in the other.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and to render the Solemnity of this Work and Day yet greater, he calls a General Aſſembly of all Men and Angels, that are, or have been, or of Men that yet ſhall be, in either Worlds, to be preſent, and ſee the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                     <p>To conclude: It is therefore called the Great Day, as that, <hi>Reſerved to the Judgment of the Great Day,</hi> Jude 6. and other Speeches. And why the Great Day? but from this Work of that Day, that ſhall be done upon it; which this Day ſhall then bring forth, and produce. As Days have their Stile and Denomination from the Work of the Day. <hi>Opus diei in die ſuo.</hi> So this (as was ſaid) is called the Day of Deſtruction, Wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if ſo, then that Stile of Greatneſs muſt be from the Greatneſs of the Work that ſhall be done thereon. And ſo the Judgment of the Great Day, becauſe great will the Judgment be that is to be executed on that Day.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly; God hath in the mean time ſuffered his Glory to be debaſed, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60376:90"/> to be leaſt regarded in the World, Sin and the Devil to carry all before them, and Sinners to have the Glory: relieving himſelf in the mean time, that he hath a <hi>Treaſure of Glory to be broken up at that day,</hi> Rom. 2. 3. When he will come on purpoſe to be glorious. He hath ſuffered an Ecclipſe of ſix thouſand Years, that in the end he may break forth with a redoubled Glory. And all that Glory muſt come in this way, even from this Puniſhment he ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. And it muſt be a recovery of greater Glory, than he ſhould have had by Man's Holineſs, in that firſt State by Creation, or God would never have let Sin have come into the World; he meant not to be a Loſer.</p>

He recompenſeth Sin, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Rector <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi,</hi> Judg of all the World, and ſo upon the account of Publick Rules given forth, to vindicate the equity and righteouſneſs of which, he puniſheth the tranſgreſſions of them; but over and above he doth it, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting an Injury, a perſonal Affront given to himſelf, his Perſon; and this draws forth his Wrath and Vengeance on his own behalf.</p>
                     <p>As it is termed <hi>Vengeance,</hi> ſo <hi>Zeal,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Do you provoke the Lord to Jealouſy?</hi> In <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 2. See what a Conglomeration there
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60376:91"/> is of Attributes and Effects. <hi>[God is jealous,]</hi> that's the firſt. He compares that in God unto that in Man, which, <hi>Solomon</hi> tell us, is the <hi>Rage of Man, Prov.</hi> 6. <hi>last.</hi> Again, 2. <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth, the Lord revengeth.</hi> That is the Effect; and he ſays it twice, as ſpeaking of one who is enflamed with Anger. Then, 3. To ſhew how fiercely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging he executes it, even with Fury, he adds, <hi>The Lord revengeth, and is furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> who yet profeſſeth elſewhere of himſelf, <hi>Fury is not in me;</hi> that is, of my ſelf it is not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4. But as he is provoked by Sin and Impenitency, ſo Fury is in him. <hi>The Lord is furious.</hi> Then, 4. follows the Subject thereof, and what they are to him, whom his Fury waxeth ſo hot againſt, <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Adverſaries. [The Lord will take Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on his Adverſaries,</hi> and <hi>he reſerveth Wrath for his Enemies.]</hi> Which accords with this Text: <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence the Adverſaries,</hi> verſe 27. And, 5. If any urge: Yea, but is not God merciful, and ſlow to Anger? Yes, ſays he, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>The Lord is ſlow to Anger.</hi> But he brings it in to ſhew, that in this caſe it is that very Patience of his, which in the iſſue works up unto that Fury: <hi>Laeſa Patientia fit Furor.</hi> And then,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60376:91"/> 6. He further warns them to conſider, that in the execution of this Fury to the utmoſt, his Power comes to be engaged: <hi>The Lord is great in Power.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>He will not at all acquit the Wicked,</hi> that lives and dies in his Sins: Which is a Clauſe or Proviſo he ſtill puts in, even when he ſpeaks the greateſt things of his Mercy. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>And although the very reading this Deſcription of God, as an Avenger, ſhews forth alone its own Dreadfulneſs, yet further to clear, and enlarge upon it, conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How it is Juſtice heightned by Wrath to a Fury, and all of theſe whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on, and drawing out the Greatneſs of Power. And to this purpoſe we find, as was obſerved, Power and Wrath joined, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>Who hath known the Power of thine Anger?</hi> His Jealouſy draws out his Strength, and his Power works in a way of Wrath. Take a Man, let his Blood, his Fury be up, and thereby all his Spirits ars inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſtirred, and he is able to ſtrike a greater and heavier blow than at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. As <hi>Sampſon</hi> in his Fury againſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> he pulls down the Pillars of the Houſe. Now bring this to God, and though his Power is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60376:92"/> the ſame, and not greater, when he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth Vengeance on his Enemies, than at all other times; yet being attributed to him after the manner of Men, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to us ſomething of Analogy, (whereby the working of his Power in ſuch a caſe is ſet out) which it holds with what is in Men in the like caſe. And ſo ſhews, 1. That if ever he did or will upon any occaſion, or can be ſuppoſed to ſhew forth Power and Strength, it will be in this, for he is in Fury; and in that Fury talks of the Greatneſs of his Power, which in Men in their Fury uſeth to be at the higheſt, and they ſhew forth their Strength in no Acts ſo much as thoſe which they do in Fury.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That comparatively therefore unto other Works of his, wherein he ſhews forth Power, he is to be ſuppoſed to ſhew forth more of Power in this. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, if God ſhewed forth Power in creating the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet according to this Analogy, I may ſay of all thoſe kind of Works whatever, (ſpeaking after the manner of Men) that he did them cooly, as it were; but this he doth in Fury, and ſo may well be ſuppoſed to put forth more of Power in theſe, in that reſpect, than in thoſe other.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:60376:92"/> 2. Avenging Wrath is more than ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Anger. A Man is angry with a Friend, and ſo is God often with his Children. And then he <hi>ſtirs not up all his Wrath,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. But the Butt and Mark, which Revenge ſhoots its Arrows at, is an Enemy, as both out of <hi>Nahum,</hi> and the <hi>27th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, was obſerved. And not only ſo, but ſuch as are irreconcileable Enemies: for that is the ſtate of Men in Hell, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of their Spirits there towards God, to be fixed in Malice. Now when Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in God ſhall be extreme, who ſhall be able to bear it?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Juſtice hath a mixture of Pity mingled with it, but when 'tis a caſe of Revenge, there is a Decorum put upon the extremity of Juſtice. It is the revenge of an Injury. Which though in the Creature, who it ſelf is a Subject of God's, (who only hath the Soveraignty of Power,) it is therefore in-glorious and unworthy, yet in God, who is the Supreme, in caſe of wrong and injury to himſelf, this hath a glory in it. <hi>Vengeance is mine,</hi> ſaith the Lord. No wonder then if it be termed <hi>Severity, Rom.</hi> 11. 23. and <hi>James</hi> 2. 13. expreſly, <hi>Judgment without Mercy.</hi> And perhaps in that reſpect alſo it is, that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10. it is termed,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60376:93"/> 
                        <hi>Wrath without mixture,</hi> that is, pure Wrath which hath no mixture; Not <hi>a drop to cool ones Tongue.</hi> And again, <hi>Wrath to the uttermoſt,</hi> as 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 16. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of that Wrath, which upon the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the Type of the day of Judgment) befel that Nation. And ſo it is ſet forth in the Language of the Wrath at the great Day, as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath obſerved, which is <hi>Wrath to the uttermoſt.</hi> And as God is ſaid to reſt in his Love ſhewn to his Children; ſo his Wrath ſatisfies it ſelf in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vengeance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 8, 9. <hi>I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh mine Anger upon thee: and I will</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>judg thee according to thy Ways, and I will recompence thee for all thine Abominations. And mine Eye ſhall not ſpare, neither will I have pity: I will recompence thee according to thy Ways, and thine Abominations that are in the midſt of thee, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord that ſmiteth.</hi> And <note place="margin">Iſa. 27. 11.</note> therefore is often called a Sacrifice, as <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 49.</p>
                     <p>And this anſwers an Objection may be made. Did not <hi>David</hi> expreſly chooſe rather to <hi>fall into the Hand of God than Man?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14. The anſwer is at hand in the ſame place, <hi>for his Mercies are great.</hi> That is <hi>David</hi>'s Reaſon for it there. And ſo indeed the difference lies
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60376:93"/> in chaſtiſing Anger, and avenging Wrath. And <hi>David</hi> there ſpeaks of God's chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Children in this World, but in the World to come you ſee the caſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: It is the falling into the Hands of an Avenger, who in that execution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to ſhew no Mercy: <hi>He that made them, will have no pity on them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, conſider how <hi>Wrath ſets all that is in God against a Man,</hi> whets and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the whole Activity of every Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. What is the reaſon that in the Text when this dreadful execution is ſpoken of, the Attribute of the <hi>[living God]</hi> is mentioned rather than Power? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Life of God ſpeaks the whole of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. The whole of his Nature and Godhead, as it is active and working: this Life imports. In Hell God draws out all his Forces, all his Attributes into the Field, whereof Wrath is the Leader and General. All his Perfections conſpire either to ſtir up and enkindle Wrath, or to aſſiſt him in the Execution. How Power is drawn forth and intended I ſhewed afore. Wiſdom, that marſhals all into Order, <hi>ſets both thy Sins in order</hi> in the view of thy Conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. and ſets his <hi>Terrors in Battel aray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee,</hi> 'tis <hi>Job</hi>'s Expreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 4. and the ſame Word in both places.

That Sinners think to illude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive God. As what is it elſe to think to defer Repentance to the laſt, and then to come and flatter, and look to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as if they had ſerved him from the very firſt Moment of their Lives? they herein think to go beyond God. 2. That in ſuch caſes, God's Wiſdom takes it and reſents it to the height. Nothing adds unto Provocation more, in a Man that is Wiſe, than to perceive how another Man thinks to go beyond him, and impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Wiſdom. And it is Wiſdom in a Man, that makes him he would not be mockt, deceived or trifled withal; this Principle riſeth up in God's Heart, the Judg of all the World. Again, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs crys out to him againſt the Sinner: Thou art a pure God, and <hi>I can endure to behold no Iniiquty,</hi> and the <hi>Eyes of my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have been provoked</hi> by this Sinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. Then ſays Juſtice too, I muſt be ſatisfyed to the utmoſt Farthing, and have the laſt drop of Blood that is in their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60376:95"/> Souls; and this their Puniſhment execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on their own Perſons, is all I ſhall have or can recover for all the diſhonour hath been done thee. For Chriſt through their unbelief, hath not taken off one Farthing of their Debt, but all is left and remains upon their own Score. And I can no other way recover Glory, but by having it out of them: And therefore it is that an Eternity is required, becauſe, but by an Eternity of Suffering, it is, that they can come to ſatisfy. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 20. <hi>Hell and Deſtruction are never full,</hi> or <hi>[ſatisfied]</hi> as the next Words ſhew the meaning to be. Then ſays Truth and Righteouſneſs, their whole Lives have been contrary to my Love, the whole actings and the courſes of them have been but a making a Lye, a Web of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, continually woven and vended. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. That <hi>love and make a Lye,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Their Tongues are full of falſhood and deceit;</hi> and again, <hi>Give them their Portion with Hypocrites:</hi> whom of all elſe I hate, ſays Truth. Then boyls up <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy,</hi> Every Creature hath been an Idol, and made their God, and ſet up in God's ſtead, and they have been enflamed with them (as of Idolaters the Prophet ſpeaks.) <hi>Idols of Jealouſy have all their Luſts been:</hi> and the Glory due to me hath been given
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60376:96"/> to them. But you will ſay, will not Mercy at laſt ſpeak a good Word for them? will it not allay and moderate all theſe? No, but turn as fiercely againſt them as any other Attribute, and plead, I indeed did a long while reſtrain all theſe other Attributes that were provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every Moment, <hi>[Whom God endured with much long ſuffering,</hi> ſays <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22.] And that they have lived ſo long free from Wrath, hath been by means of me; I waiting for their Repentance, which hath coſt me Millions. I have ſpent Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on them, in forbearance of them: All which now is to be reckoned to them in Wrath. You have it <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>They have deſpiſed the riches of his Goodneſs, and Forbearance, and long-Suffering, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth them to Repentance. But after their hardneſs and impenitent Heart, treaſure up unto themſelves Wrath, &amp;c.</hi> And ſays Grace, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed on, and made a ſtale to, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their Luſts; and was <hi>turned into Wantonneſs, Jude</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>And thus all in God, is ſet (as it were) a Fire againſt a Sinner, and (as I may ſo ſpeak) do turn all in him into fury. And look as to God's People all in God is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulated into Love towards them, and they live in and dwell in Love, and ſee
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60376:96"/> nothing elſe, as it were in God, but Love: <hi>God is Love</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) namely, to his own, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16.

What was it cauſed this ſudden out-cry and alteration in <hi>Job</hi>'s Spirit, from that ſtill and ſedate frame we left him in before? What was it the thoughts of his loſt Eſtate, Children, Wife's unkindneſs, or the Pains of his Bones and Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or his downfal from a petty Kingdom? Did theſe begin now at length ſo ſadly to return upon him, ſo as in the end, his Spirit ſhould begin to take them in, and lay them at length to Heart, which at firſt he in an holy Gallantry had made ſo light of? Oh no, he had fully concocted and digeſted all that had been occaſioned from all or any of theſe, and had quieted himſelf with one or two good Cordials, namely, that <hi>the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, and bleſſed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> Chap. 1. 21.

That <hi>God's Wrath lay hard</hi> or <hi>heavy on him,</hi> and ſays no more of it: But <hi>Job</hi> here, He in like manner feeling the like weight thereof, goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to expreſs how heavy, and how great the burthen was of his Grief, that was cauſed thereby. And he calls for a mighty Scale to weigh it in: Such a Scale as might be large enough to contain all the <hi>Sands of the Sea. Oh that my Grief were throughly weighed, and my Calamities laid in the Ballance together! for now it would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea.</hi> His meaning is, that to have his Grief and Calamity put in one of the Scales, and the Sand of the Sea in the other, his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity would be infinitely heavier. His invention was heightned by what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally felt: The greatneſs of it made him
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60376:98"/> Eloquent. (For as Love, ſo deep ſenſe of Miſery uſeth ſo to do.) And he pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as you ſee, upon the weightineſs of Sand, to expreſs it by, which is of all things the weightieſt, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 3. <hi>A Stone is heavy, and the Sand is weighty.</hi> Yea, and the <hi>Sand of the Sea:</hi> which, take both, thoſe Sands within the Sea at the bottom of it, and thoſe alſo ſcattered without on the Shoar, they do make an immence bulk and body condenſated, if they were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together into one heap: (as the Waters were into one place, when God made the Sea.) <hi>Job</hi> had a moſt ſublime Fancy, as the high ſtrains of that whole Book ſhew: And this is in view a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon vaſt and great enough, (one would think,) as could be uſed. But yet further obſerve, how he breaks off that attempt of his, to expreſs it by this or by any ſuch compariſons, though in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance never ſo hyperbolical. Which breaking off, his next Speech utters: <hi>My Words</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are ſwallowed up!</hi> As a ſmall thing is ſwallowed up of a greater, as a drop of the Ocean, as one ſmall ſcattered Sand would be, in the bulk of all thoſe Sands of the Sea, when caſt in among them: So, were all theſe his vaſt expreſſions and compariſons he had
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60376:99"/> uſed, although thus great; (which yet from all Rhetoricians, would have had the name of <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> far exceeding the reality.) But yet in his ſenſe and feeling were ſwallowed up by the thing it ſelf. <hi>I feel my Words fall ſhort,</hi> ſays he: ſo <hi>Broughton</hi> paraphraſeth on thoſe Words. And therefore he cuts himſelf off from uſing any more or higher decipherings of it, of any kind, if any could have been found, as being all but meer Metaphors, too light, and holding no weight with that far exceeding weight of Miſery, he felt (as the Apoſtle on the contrary, comparing preſent Afflictions and the Glory to come together, ſpeaks) but <hi>Job</hi> here, he gives it clean over as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible. And in ſtead of all Eſſays that way, he chooſeth rather to ſpeak and ſhew the Cauſe thereof the ſame, which I in this Treatiſe have endeavoured to do. And thereby he ſets forth in a Reality, the dreadfulneſs of it indeed; And more than by all things whatever, that his Grief could have been compared unto. This you have in theſe Words. <hi>[For the Arrows of the Almighty, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me,]</hi> he had ſores without, in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and Afflictions in his outward Man or Condition; Fears without, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors within: he complains not, that you
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60376:99"/> hear of them at all. Oh but they are theſe Arrows that are within me, (ſays he) the <hi>Arrows of the Almighty.</hi> That is, which none but an <hi>Almighty Hand</hi> could ſhoot, and ſhoot ſo deep: ſuch Arrows, as could come out of no other Forge or Quiver. The Soul of a Man is a Spirit of a vaſt depth, and God, and God alone can ſhoot up into it, unto the Arrow Head. And yet again, beſides the ſtrength of the Arm that ſhoots them, and the forkedneſs of the Arrows themſelves, they were all, as Arrows that are dipt in Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, envenomed with the guilt of his Sins (which as <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 23. &amp; 26. God had now ſet on upon his Soul, <hi>Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me poſſeſs the Sins of my Youth:)</hi> Thus it follows in the next Words, <hi>[And the Poyſon thereof drinks up my Spirit.]</hi> They do not only <hi>let out the Spirits,</hi> (which Wounds made by other Arrows uſe to do) but <hi>they drink them up.</hi> The Strength and Violence of the Venom of them, had ſuch an Efficacy on his very Soul, and the very Spirit and Life thereof, as they drank all up. Again it follows, <hi>[And the Terrors of God have ſet themſelves in array againſt me.]</hi> God drew forth his Wrath (as it were) into an ordered Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, into Rank and File, at once to fall upon him. If one Man had an whole
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60376:100"/> Army ſet againſt him, and each armed Man therein were to ſhoot a Bullet, or an Arrow into him at once; and if withal we could make the Suppoſition, that that Man ſhould have his Life ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after each Wound given, ſo as never to dye; and yet they ſtill to renew to ſhoot all at once every moment: how dreadful is this to any ones Thoughts thereof? but yet theſe are but Men, not God, whoſe Arrows he ſays theſe were. <hi>Oh that he would deſtroy me!</hi> (ſays <hi>Job)</hi> that is, <hi>kill me out-right,</hi> ſo ver. 8, 9. <hi>Oh that I might have my Request! and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! Even that it would pleaſe God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me, and that he would let looſe his Hand, and cut me off.</hi> Well, But <hi>Job,</hi> canſt thou not ſtir up thy Spirits and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thy ſelf againſt all theſe preſent Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows? The <hi>Spirit of Man will bear its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> if it be ſteel'd with reſolution. To this <hi>Job</hi> himſelf gives anſwer by way of preoccupation, to this effect: That if Death indeed, or a being utterly cut off, ſhould come upon me with all that <hi>Hoſt of Fears</hi> (whereof elſewhere <hi>Job</hi> tells us <hi>Death is the King)</hi> I could harden my ſelf againſt that; yea, and to endure the pains of the moſt exquiſite Tortures any kind of Death could inflict: if thereby
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60376:100"/> 
                        <hi>God would thus cut me off.</hi> Then indeed (if ſuch News of Death were brought me) <hi>I ſhould yet have comfort; yea, I would harden my ſelf in Sorrow.</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And let it be the worſt Death, he can put me to, for ſo it follows, <hi>let him not ſpare.</hi> Oh but they are theſe Arrows of his own within me, theſe I cannot bear. So ver. 12. <hi>Is my Strength the Strength of Stones, or my Fleſh Braſs?</hi> that I ſhould be able to endure, and bear up my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Encounters? Oh no. Read on thoſe his Expreſſions further roared forth by him, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>He hath broken me aſunder: he hath alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me by the Neck, and ſhaken me to peices, and ſet me up for his Mark. His Archers compaſs me round about, he cleaveth my Reins aſunder, and doth not ſpare; He poureth out my Gall upon the Ground. He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a Giant.</hi> What ſhould I inſtance in more, or how to comment on them!</p>
                     <p>That which in the ſecond place, is proper next to be done, is to provoke thoſe that are ſecure Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo that are awakened, to raiſe but up their Thoughts from the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, to infer and gather how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful this Puniſhment in Hell muſt be, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60376:101"/> all, that theſe Diſpenſations can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us. And this is moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred from theſe Examples, whether they be the Examples of Good Men, as <hi>Job</hi> was; or bad Men, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> were, in both which I formerly inſtanced in. I ſhall make Inference from each of theſe apart, as in the firſt Section, I alſo did, in arguing from them, the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. From theſe of good Men. If you conſider that all theſe Terrors, wich <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Heman</hi> endured from God, were yet all in Love, out of ſo ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial a Love, permanent and abiding in God's Heart, all this while towards them; and that all theſe were but chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of them for tryal, <hi>and to make them partakers of his Holineſs.</hi> And beſides, what manner of Anger was it towards them? It was but Anger, which Love ſtirred up: and thoſe his Afflictions were accompanied and joyned, all with <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kindneſs and thoughts of Peace</hi> all the while. According to that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 8. <hi>In a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee, for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redemer.</hi> Yea, thoſe two known Cordial <hi>Recipes,</hi> ſo frequently made uſe of, and commonly taken by moſt Chriſtians in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60376:101"/> their diſtreſſes; and cited by two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Chriſt himſelf from Heaven, <hi>Happy is the Man whom God correcteth</hi>

Oh think then how great will that Vengeance be, which is pure Wrath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. which is out of Fury, as was ſhewn: which is, the fiery Indignation of Patience abuſed; boyl'd up into Fury! This that befel them, is ſaid to be but a little Wrath, and for a Moment. And yet (as alſo it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.) If God be angry but a little, who is able to abide it!</hi> then what will this laſt and extream Vengeance reſerved for Hell be? Theſe Chaſtiſements of <hi>Job's</hi> and <hi>Heman</hi>'s were in compariſon of what awaits Men in Hell, but as Rods of Birch or <hi>Ruſhes,</hi> which we uſe to whip our Children withal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 32, 33. <hi>Then will I viſit their Tranſgreſſions with the Rod, and their Iniquity with Stripes: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, my loving-kindneſs will I not utterly</hi>

Yea, but theſe wherewith wicked Men in Hell are eternally laſh'd and cut off, are <hi>Rods of Revenges making; Rods of Iron</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt in that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Pſalm ſpeaks) <hi>to break them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel,</hi> never to be ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again or made whole. Again, thoſe ſtroaks on the Children of God, are in meaſure, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 7, 8. but of theſe in Hell, it may be, and is ſaid, that <hi>Wrath cometh upon them without meaſure.</hi> Again, in the midſt of theſe Corrections, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members Mercy; but in this of Hell, there <hi>is Judgment without Mercy,</hi> Jam. 2. 13. In thoſe other Stripes given his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>God himſelf is afflicted,</hi> and feels e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Stroak he gives them, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 20. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. But in theſe in Hell, Vengeance and Juſtice do ſatisfy themſelves in their deſerved Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is ſtiled a Sacrifice to him.

                     <p n="2">2. The ſame Inference, may be much more raiſed from thoſe Inſtances given of bad Men, ſuffering in this Life the like Terrors, to theſe mentioned: If we but conſider that when they fall and ſeize upon them in the greateſt extremity, that yet then they are in compariſon to what remains to them in Hell, but as the ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the top of that Cup here, the Dregs whereof are reſerved for them, there, to drink to the bottom, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 8. <hi>In the Hand of the Lord there is a Cup, and the Wine is red: it is full of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he poureth out of the ſame: but the Dregs thereof all the Wicked of the Earth ſhall wring them out, and drink them.</hi> Thoſe Words he <hi>[poureth out of the ſame]</hi> and <hi>[but the Dregs thereof]</hi> are an oppoſition each to other; ſhewing how that in this Life, God promiſcuouſly poureth forth the ſame from the upper part thereof, both upon good and bad. And that all that, is but the overflowings of what is uppermoſt; but the Dregs, the brackiſh bitter Stuff, is reſerved for Hell. And the truth is, Men can bear but the ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings thereof here. Should they drink but a little deeper, their Souls would be giddy, and reel out of their Bodies in a Moment. As the Joys of Heaven cannot
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60376:103"/> be <hi>inherited by Fleſh and Blood,</hi> ſo nor the <hi>Torments of the fulneſs of this Wrath.</hi>

All the Terrors of Conſcience here, are as is ſaid of the Joys of the Saints, but the earneſt-Pennies, Farthing-Tokens, in compariſon to that great, <hi>immenſely vast Treaſure of Wrath to come,</hi> you have heard the Scriptures ſpeak of. All here is but the Shadow of Death; and yet if that can wither Mens Souls ſo, what will the <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs do?</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt threatned here, is, that <hi>The Anger of the Lord ſhall ſmoke againſt a Man, Deut.</hi> 29.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The last Head of Demonſtrations: That it is a falling into the Hands of the Living God: and what that further ſuper adds to the dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Puniſhment.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe fifth and laſt Head, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the dreadfulneſs of all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an infinity, is, that it is <hi>a falling into the Hands [of the living God,] The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</hi> The former exaggerations have been raiſed from falling into the Hands of the Great, Powerful, Juſt and Avenging God; but this further, <hi>of the Living God.</hi> Which of all other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, the Apoſtle hath ſingled forth to ſet out the dreadfulneſs of it by, and is therefore moſt of all to be heeded by us; as having as much weight in it, to the thing in Hand, as any of the other. <hi>[The Living God]</hi> notes out, not only God's Activity, and how the whole of his Life and Being is engaged and active in this Puniſhment (as was noticed)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60376:104"/> But further, both, that, 1. He ſhall execute this to Eternity, and 2. That during that whole ſpace of Eternity, he will permanently continue, to inflict it. His being the <hi>Living God</hi> notes out 1. Eternity, 2. With a continuation of acting all that while: And ſo his being the Living God, both threatens and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, 1. an eternal, and 2. a continual Death in thoſe that are the Subjects thereof. And to imply ſo much it is, that he hath that Denomination ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and ſo eminently given him here, when this Puniſhment is ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, conſider thy Soul is an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul, as to the duration of it: and that this Great God is the Living God. And Sin in thee and the Injury of it to God is an eternal Stain, which Hell Fire cannot eat out, or ſatisfy God for, but in an Eternity of time. And therefore whilſt God lives, and thou liveſt, he will inflict it on thee. That's one meaning.</p>
                     <p>Again, God's <hi>Life,</hi> as it is in himſelf a continual Act, ſo in its being attributed to him with reſpect to this Puniſhment, it imports his continued acting therein without ceſſation or intermiſſion. For he doth it, as the Living God. <hi>Job,</hi> whilſt he endured the Terrors of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60376:104"/> Almighty, complains they were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant, that God <hi>ſuffered him not to take Breath,</hi> Job 9. 18. he followed his Stroaks ſo thick, <hi>with one Breach</hi> (as he there ſpeaks) <hi>upon another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have both theſe ſet forth in one and the ſame Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 10, 11. <hi>He ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, and he ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: and the ſmoak of their Torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever. And they have no reſt Day nor Night.</hi> Firſt, they have <hi>no reſt Day nor Night;</hi> That ſhews they have no intermiſſion. And then that the ſmoak of their Torment <hi>aſcends up for ever,</hi> ſhews the Eternity. Yea and further, to ſtrike out dull Hearts, with the ſenſe of this Eternity, if one <hi>[ever]</hi> be not enough, another is added, <hi>[For ever and ever.]</hi> Which Eternity as you know, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is ſtill careful to indigitate, when he ſpeaks of Hell, in love and warning unto Mens Souls, that they might be moved by the moment thereof, to endeavour to eſcape it.</p>
                     <p>Now it being thus, this infinitely ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradds unto all the former. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Heads have given Demonſtration to us, wherein the ſubſtance of this great
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60376:105"/> Puniſhment conſiſts: And then comes in this, as the fatal and final rowling Stone upon the Grave or Sepulchre of Souls: And with the Grave, Hell is oft parral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd. Or theſe two imports thereof, are as two Mill-Stones hung about the Necks of thoſe that are plunged into this Lake, to ſink them down for ever: For theſe two things mentioned, do work in the Spirits of thoſe that undergoe it, Perfect Fear: and perfect Deſpair. The Effects of both which make up a perfection of Miſery in ſuch a State.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Perfect Deſpair. Hope was given to reaſonable and intelligent Natures (and in peculiar unto them) to be as a breathing hole in time of Miſery, to keep up Life in ſuch an one, whereby to ſuſtain it ſelf. And the reaſonable Soul being in its duration Eternal, and having an Eternity of time to run through and ſail over, hath this Priviledge (denied to Beaſts) to take a proſpect or fore-ſight of time, that is yet to come, and if it can ſpy out any ſpace or ſpot of time, in which it ſhall have happineſs or eaſe, or out-live its Miſery, it will not utterly die; yea it will harden it ſelf againſt preſent Miſery with this Thought, <hi>that however it ſhall not always be thus with me.</hi> But on
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60376:105"/> the contrary here, by reaſon of this abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of fore-ſight, it comes to paſs, that a wretched Soul in Hell, viewing and turning over all the Leaves of Time to Eternity, both finds that it ſhall not out-live that Miſery, nor yet can it find one ſpace or moment of Time of Freedom and Intermiſſion, having for ever to do with him who is the Living God. And then it dies and dies again, and ſinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Gulph of Deſpair, for the future, as well as it is ſwallowed up with preſent ſenſe of Wrath.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Perfect Fear. Which theſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſe, and keep up within that Soul; and that continually of all their Miſery, that is yet to come. And the nature of Fear is, to out-ſtrip a Man's Miſery; and to take them up afore they come, as Hopes uſe to do our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: So as by reaſon thereof, it comes to paſs that the Soul is not only tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by what it at preſent feels, but with the thought of all that is to come; which ſtill further ſtrikes that Soul through and through. So as this Thought, that it will be with me thus for ever and ever, makes it compleatly miſerable. Yea hereby, the Soul doth come all along in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60376:106"/> to endure and be poſſeſſed in Fears and Dreadful Apprehenſions of all that Woe, that in Eternity is yet to come, as well as that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

Which Maxim is founded upon an high Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Reaſon and Equity. God puts the whole of this matter ſo far off from himſelf, that he lays all, both Sin and Puniſhment, wholly upon Man; ſo as although the Puniſhment it ſelf be from his own juſt Wrath, that is provoked to inflict it, yet even thereof he thus ſpeaks, <hi>Do they provoke me to Anger?</hi> ('tis true, they do;) <hi>but do they not provoke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the Confuſion of their own Faces?</hi> So as he aſcribes his own Wrath that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts that Puniſhment whollly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, returns even that upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

And it is certain, that in order thereto he will ſpeak all Fairneſs, Equity, Juſtice, and Reaſon, ('twere not Conviction elſe); and he will have all his Saints and Angels about him, as Judges and Witneſſes. He will have all the World to hear it; and how equal it is for him to execute ſo ſore a Vengeance. And as he will convince them of their Deeds to be ungodly and deſerving it, ſo of their hard Speeches; and that (whatever his Decrees were,) they themſelves were ungodly, and their Deeds ungodly, and ungodlily commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                     <p>The <hi>90th</hi> Pſalm was penned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as the Title ſhews, <hi>A Prayer of</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Man of God,)</hi> and it was compoſed by him in his latter days, after he had ſeen in forty years, an whole Generation in a Nation of Men removed out of this World, and their <hi>Carcaſes fallen in the Wilderneſs;</hi> a Spectacle ſo ſad, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not any one Man in the World hath ſeen, or Age afforded, (but at the Flood) afore or ſince, in ſo ſhort a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of time. His Song is a Funeral Elegy, or Meditation of Death, made upon that whole Generation, <hi>verſe</hi> 3.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60376:108"/> 
                        <hi>Thou turneſt Man to Deſtruction; and ſayeſt, Return, ye Children of Men.</hi> And verſes 5, 6. <hi>Thou carriest them away, as with a Flood. In the morning they are like Graſs which groweth up; in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it flouriſheth and groweth up, in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</hi> And God from that time began alſo to ſtint and limit Man's years to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which it hath held to unto this day. Verſ. 10. <hi>The Days of our years are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years and ten; and if by reaſon of Strength they be fourſcore years, yet is their Strength Labour and Sorrow; for it is ſoon cut off, and we fly away.</hi> Our Souls fly away like Birds when the Shell is broke; and then Hell follows, (as the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaks) as in reality, ſo in <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſcourſe. And that was it which was the matter of deepeſt and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thoughts in this Meditation unto him of any other. Verſe 11. it follows, <hi>Who knoweth the Power of thine Anger? Even according to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath.—</hi>Which he utters,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By way of <hi>Lamentation.</hi> He ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a moſt doleful complaint againſt the Security and Stupor he obſerved in that Generation of Men in his times, both in thoſe that had already died in their Sins, as well as of that new Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60376:109"/> that had come up in their room, who ſtill lived in their Sins. O! ſays he, <hi>Who of them knoweth the Power of thine Anger?</hi> namely, of that Wrath which followeth after Death, and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth upon Mens Souls for ever; that is, who conſiders it, or regards it, till it take hold upon them? He utters it,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a way of Aſtoniſhment, out of the apprehenſion he had of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Wrath: <hi>Who hath known the Power of thine Anger!</hi> that is, who who hath or can take it in according to the greatneſs of it? Which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſet forth (as applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our own apprehenſions) in this wiſe, <hi>Even according to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath.</hi> Where thoſe words <hi>[thy Fear]</hi> are taken <hi>objective,</hi> and ſo is all one, and the <hi>Fear of thee:</hi> And ſo the meaning is, that according to whatever proportion our Souls can take in, in fears of thee and of thine Anger; ſo great is thy Wrath it ſelf. You have Souls that are able to comprehend vaſt Fears and Terrors; they are as extenſive in their Fears, as in their Deſires, which are ſtretched, beyond what this World or the Creatures can afford them, to an Infinity. The Soul of Man is a dark Cell, which when it begets Fears once, ſtrange and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60376:109"/> fearful Apparitions riſe up in it, which far exceed the ordinary proportion of worldly Evils, (which yet alſo our Fears uſually make greater than they prove to be:) But here, as to that Puniſhment, which is the effect of God's own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Wrath, let the Soul enlarge it ſelf, ſays he, and widen its apprehenſion to the utmoſt; fear what you can imagine: yet ſtill God's Wrath, and the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it inflicts, are not only propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, but infinitely exceeding all you can fear or imagine. <hi>Who knoweth the Power of thine Anger?</hi> [It paſſeth knowledg.]</p>
                     <p>Now the Uſe <hi>Moſes</hi> makes of all this Doctrine of Death and Wrath, in the next following verſe 12. is this: <hi>So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts to VViſdom.</hi> This he ſpake to God in behalf of that preſent Generation that then ſurvived; and by ſpreading afore them all theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, thereby alſo exhorteth them to that which is the only true Wiſdom, even to turn unto the Lord, ſo to eſcape that Wrath that is to come. And he, as an holy Man, that knew the Terror of the Lord, doth thus perſuade Men: And O let our Souls be perſuaded by it. And to this end,</p>

                     <p>I Would firſt perſuade you to believe, that there is this Wrath to come. <hi>VVe knowing the Terror of the Lord;</hi> that is, our ſelves being aſſured by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that ſuch a Wrath is in the Heart and Breaſt of God againſt impenitent Sinners, as alſo underſtanding what and how dreadful that Wrath is, we do <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade Men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. And for Men to apprehend and believe it, is the firſt moſt effectual Engine to perſuade them by. God did not, ere he placed theſe Souls of ours in our Bodies, firſt carry them down to Hell, and then up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſo we having a fore-knowledg of either by Sight and Senſe, might then be left to act in this World accordingly: But God hath left only the Revelation of both theſe unto Faith, in this World, by the Word.<hi>—Heb.</hi> 11. 7. 'Tis ſaid, Noah <hi>being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with Fear, prepared an Ark to the ſaving of his Houſe: By the which he condemned the VVorld, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi>

                     <p> You know how the Day of this great Wrath to come (the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is aſſimilated by Chriſt to the Days of <hi>Noah, Mat.</hi> 24. 37, 38, 39. And that (among other) in reſpect of the Security and Unbelief that is and will be afore it comes, in the Hearts of Men about it, (which is Chriſt's ſpecial ſcope there.) And the place in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> cited anſwerably, reckoneth that Faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> (who being forewarned of the Flood, was moved with Fear, and prepared an Ark to ſave himſelf and his Family,) amongſt thoſe other Inſtances of Saving Faith, which that Chapter doth enumerate, as that which had this Wrath to come ſignified thereby in his eye. Shewing withal the Foundation of the Condemnation of that World to lie in this, That though <hi>Noah</hi> declared this Wrath to come unto them by his Preaching and Example, (for as he was a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, ſo of this Wrath, as <hi>Enoch</hi> alſo had been,) yet they believed it not, becauſe it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen; as the words of that <hi>7th</hi> Verſe are. For theſe things then happened in Types of what was to fall out concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great Wrath to come; that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the old World being but the ſhadow of this, as expreſly 'tis interpreted
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60376:111"/> to be, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>The Spirits in Priſon, which ſometimes were diſobedient, when once the Long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing. The like Figure whereunto is Baptiſm, which now alſo ſaves us.</hi> If the Ark was of Salvation, then the Flood of Damnation; and that, <hi>then,</hi> as the word <hi>[alſo]</hi> now evidently ſhews. This Wrath, it is a thing to come, as that of the Flood then was to them, ſtiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Wrath to come;</hi> and ſo it is a thing not ſeen, and ſo is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Objects of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Men indeed have ſome leſſer ſtitches in Conſcience afore-hand, both from it and about it, but little do they imagine that theſe will or ſhould ever become the matter of ſuch torturing Aches, as they riſe up to in the end: Men do as little imagine this of theſe fore-running War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or ſecret Gripings and Twitches, as the Old World did then, that the uſual Clouds of Heaven that cauſed Storms, would have ever ſwell'd to the drowning of the World. Nor indeed doth this fall out to Mens Souls, until the Curſe or Wrath of God enters, <hi>like Oil into their Bones,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of <hi>Judas, Pſal.</hi> 109. 18.</p>

                     <p>The Baptiſt, who began the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Goſpel, he began it with forewarning Men of this Wrath, and ſtiled it, the <hi>Wrath to come:</hi> And Chriſt, whoſe office was to preach that Goſpel, ſeconds him therein, and terms it <hi>Hell-Fire,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60376:114"/> themſelves, of and to whom it is he ſpeaks this. There was never a Nation of the Heathens, but the Stories of it would have afforded a Theatre of God's Judgments againſt all ſorts of Evils in in one Perſon or other, ſingled out by Decimation (as it were) in this World, to ſhew thereby that there was an hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Wrath to come in the other World, which would fall upon all the reſt, who yet eſcaped at preſent.

But after thy hardneſs, and impenitent Heart, [treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</hi> And unto this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you may put the enumeration of thoſe Inſtances of Judgment made by the other Apoſtles, as thoſe upon the Angels that fell, and on the Old World, on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Corah,</hi> &amp;c. whereof though ſome were outward and temporal Puniſhments, yet becauſe they were Evidences of that Wrath to come upon like impenitent Sinners, both theſe Apoſtles do to that purpoſe allege them, and make uſe thereof to beget this Belief in us.

Now all this I can do (ſays God) with a meer Look, whenever I pleaſe: And I can as eaſily ſave alſo, as I can thus deſtroy, (which thou canſt not do thine own Soul) as the next Verſe inſinuates, <hi>Then will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thine own hand can ſave thee.</hi> You ſee he reſolves ſaving and deſtroying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Power of his, and maketh the ſame eſtimate of either; which the Apoſtle alſo doth, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Exhortation therefore in fine is, Let us not fear Creatures, <hi>but fear Him,</hi>

                     <p>Conſider, <hi>What it is to die,</hi> and <hi>what the State and Condition of the other World is.</hi> It is to have to do with God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, either in Wrath or Love; and from his own hands, as well as from the immediate Sentence of his Mouth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy Weal or Woe.—That we come <hi>naked into this World,</hi> and go as naked out of it, was <hi>Job</hi>'s Meditation firſt; after that <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 15. <hi>We ſhall carry nothing away,</hi> that is, of what belongs to this World; then after him <hi>Solomon</hi> the Son, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>As he came forth of his Mothers Womb</hi> (ſpeaking of Man) <hi>naked ſhall he return, to go as he came, and ſhall take nothing of his Labour, which he may carry away in his Hand.</hi> The Effect of which divine Meditation comes to this, To put ſecure and careleſs Man upon the conſideration of his immortal Souls Condition, which firſt cometh into this World naked (as well as his Body:) And poor thing! the meaning of its firſt cry (if the Soul it ſelf could then ſpeak out its mind) is, I am an <hi>empty thing, and have brought nothing with me; who will ſhew me any good?</hi> But after its being grown up, it begins to find a World richly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60376:119"/> furniſhed with all things to enjoy, as the Apoſtle's Phraſe is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. But yet again when he goes out of this World, he is then turned out of Houſe and Home, as perfectly naked as he came into it: and as <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>The Fruits that thy Soul luſted after, and all things which are dainty and goodly, are departed from thee, and thou ſhalt find them no more at all.</hi> Death is therefore compared unto the breaking or failing of a Merchant or Tradeſman proving Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. <hi>That when ye fail, &amp;c.</hi> ſays Chriſt; of which I have elſewhere ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Now if this be thy caſe as to this and that other World, think with thy ſelf what thine eternal Soul muſt then betake it ſelf unto, and alſo unto whom in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. My Doctrinal part hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you that <hi>it is God himſelf, God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,—Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>The Spirit returns unto him that gave it.</hi> To explain which, There was that evident difference put in the making man's Soul at firſt from that of his Body, That God made the Body out of the Earth, but the Soul was breathed in by God; and therefore not out of any preexiſtent matter, as the Souls and Forms of all other living things are. And upon this diſſolution or ſeparation of each from other, it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Then ſhall the Duſt return to the Earth as it was:</hi>
                        <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60376:120"/> 
                        <hi>and the Soul to God that gave it;</hi> that is to ſay, the ſame common Law befalls either in their kind, that to other things in their kind; they are reduced unto their firſt Principles. And ſo look as the Body is materially reſolved into the Earth, which was the firſt matter of it; ſo according to ſome kind of Analogy thereunto, (and ſo far as the Soul is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a like return unto God,) the <hi>Soul returns to God that gave it;</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the immediate Original of it, not materially, as a Spark is out of the Fire, but as the immediate Efficient. It came from God by way of Gift, <hi>God gave it;</hi> that is, freely and voluntarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it by a ſole, ſingle, free Act of his Will and Power, whereby he created it out of nothing; and ſo in the whole of it, it was an entire and meer Gift of his. And therefore in the beginning of his Exhortation, verſe 1 of this Chap. he had aforehand laid this as a Foundation for it, <hi>Remember thy Creator,</hi> or <hi>Creators,</hi> and is ſo ſtiled, becauſe he is in a more ſpecial manner thy Creator, than of our Bodies, or of other Creatures; and that becauſe himſelf immediately gave thy Soul, in ſuch a manner as he produced not our Bodies, nor material Subſtances.—And hence it is it returns to him, as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60376:120"/> the immediate Judg or Arbiter of its eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condition. It returns to <hi>Elohim;</hi> which, as <hi>A Lapide</hi> and <hi>Ferdinandus</hi>

Now then think what it is to die; it is to <hi>return to God,</hi> ſo as eternally and immediately to have to do with him.</p>
                     <p>And then withal conſider the different Diſpenſations of this Great God towards you in this World, and that next. In this World Mens Souls having Creature-Comforts, God communicates himſelf unto them thereby; and by reaſon of his Patience and Long-ſuffering to them added hereto, they hear not of, nor from him immediatly; the moſt of Men do not otherwiſe than in theſe mediate ways. <hi>I was altogether ſilent,</hi> ſays God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. He anſwers them neither good nor bad. And thus tho he is not far off from any of us, but Men live and move in him, in reſpect of his Power to uphold them, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. or, as <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>He giveth Life</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60376:121"/> 
                        <hi>and Breath unto all things;</hi> (which Clauſe doth interpret that other, <hi>v.</hi> 28.) Yet as to converſe with, or intimate knowledg of him, he is the <hi>unknown God,</hi> v. 23. and Men live without God (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) in this World, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                     <p>But altho Men thus live without God here, they ſhall not live (I might ſay [not die] rather, for it is a Death,) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World to come. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you think with your ſelves, how that your Converſe with this Great God in this World is (I expreſs it by that of Men with a Lion, comparatively,) but as through a Grate, (as that of the Spouſe's with him is ſaid to be but <hi>through a Lettice, Cant.</hi> 2. 9.) And he keeps to the Laws of his ordinary Providence: he breaks not forth immediatly, but lies ſtill and quiet; and through his patience ſuffereth and permitteth Men to walk by him, and do all their Hearts deſire, and lets them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. But, Brethren, when you come to die; it is as if one were turned in unto that Lion with the Grate open; and thoſe <hi>Repagula</hi> of his Patience removed, your poor Souls, your naked Souls, are upon him immediatly, and muſt (in a clean contrary way to what the Saints do) dwell with him for ever.—The Conſideration of this ſtruck dread and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60376:121"/> horror into the Hearts of the Sinners of <hi>Sion,</hi> (as it may well do in any Soul that hath not Communion with God.) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 14. <hi>The Sinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites; [who among us ſhall dwell] with the devouring Fire? Who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> (I opened that place afore, and ſhewed that this devouring Fire was God himſelf:) Theſe ſpeak one to another as Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted uſe to do, and as ſtruck on the ſudden with apprehenſions of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that God, whom their Conſciences (now awakened) told them they had to do withal for ever. And they look trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling one on the other, and the common cry and voice among them thereupon is, Whoſe Portion will this prove to be? For it will be the Portion of ſome: or, Who of us, or all Creatures, is able to bear it or endure it? And upon this Conference (as I may term it) and inquiſition among themſelves, God by the Prophet ſteps out and anſwers them, but in a clean contrary way, and to their further confuſion, and tells them: There are thoſe that ſhall dwell with me thus immediately, unto whom <hi>I will be Glory and Happineſs,</hi> who ſhall walk in the comfort of this Fire which you thus dread; and who (like the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60376:122"/> three Children in that fiery Furnace) ſhall be refreſhed therein. So it follows, <hi>He that walks righteouſly, and ſpeaks uprightly, he ſhall dwell on high.</hi> And therefore it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follows, 1. as a Promiſe to the upright and <hi>pure in Heart, ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Thine Eyes ſhall ſee the King in his Glory.</hi> And 2. with a further threatning to the Hypocrites, <hi>Thine Heart,</hi> who art an Hypocrite, <hi>ſhall meditate Terror, ver.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>Now then again, ſeeing you have thus to do with the great God alone for ever, let every one of <hi>us prepare to meet our God.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Amos 4.</note> This neceſſarily puts you upon ſeeking of him here in this World, and to ſeek that Face and favour of his, in which alone is Life. You muſt therefore alſo give up your Souls unto him here, to live in him, as in your chiefeſt Good, and not in your Luſts; and to live to him, as your higheſt End and conſtant Intereſt; and as whoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould act and ſteer you in all your ways; and not unto your ſelves. And therefore you, that have neglected this great God, or ſerved him but in Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Hypocriſy, (which in Scripture hath the denomination of thoſe <hi>that forget God)</hi> who never knew what it is to have intimate Communion and Fellowſhip with him through Faith in Prayer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Converſes, joined with hearty Love
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60376:122"/> unto him, and to the Intereſt of his <hi>Glory:</hi> Think, O think with your ſelves, when you come to die, that you muſt go to him, and be with him for ever, in that ſence I have given. Think with thy ſelf thus: My Soul will be turned naked out of this World, and there is nothing, no not a Rag of any of the Comforts I purſue after here, which ſhall be carried with it from hence; but it is the great God I muſt be turned naked unto, and appear afore; and if my Soul be found naked of his Image too, (which to have renewed in me was the only Errand he ſent my Soul for into this World) and if I bring not that along with me, as my current Token, Ticket, and Paſs into the other World, there will not be a dwelling-place of Bliſs for me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me into; not ſuch an one as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of for the Comfort of the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 3. <hi>We know that if our earthly Tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a Building of God; if ſo be we ſhall not be found naked,</hi> v. 3. that is, <hi>devoid</hi> of his <hi>Image,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</hi> But inſtead thereof this great God will be unto me as a Furnace, and I muſt dwell with thoſe <hi>everlaſting Burnings</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>even for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then think with thy ſelf again: What communion or correſpondency hath my Soul kept and held with God?
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60376:123"/> what acquaintance hath it had with him? For otherwiſe it will be <hi>ſtrange</hi> you ſhould commend your Souls into his hands, (as Chriſt did, and the Saints uſe to do when they die) and that with a deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to live that Eternity with him which is to come, and yet not to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at all with him or to him here. How doſt thou think thou canſt look him in the face at thy firſt appearance afore him? <hi>If they ſhould take thy Soul away from thee</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 20</note> 
                        <hi>this Night,</hi> as Chriſt's ſpeech is, how canſt thou think God ſhould then at firſt look on thee, much leſs take thee into eternal, immediate <hi>Boſom-communion</hi> with himſelf for ever? I pray, <hi>upon what acquaintance?</hi> And ſo may God alſo ſay unto thee. <hi>O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth;</hi> learn to know and fear him; <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelf with him, and be at Peace: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>

                     <p>Again, think with thy ſelf, What do I purſuing after the things of this Life with my deareſt affections, and utmoſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Alas! I am to live for ever with God, and not with theſe. The Apoſtle ſets forth a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> upon it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>We brought nothing into this World, and it is certain</hi> (or manifeſt, ſays he, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,) <hi>we carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out:</hi> and thereby provokes them to purſue with might and main <hi>after Godlines,</hi>

And this is the manifeſt coherence of thoſe two Sayings, following immediatly one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe two verſes, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>But Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Contentment is great Gain. For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out:</hi> the latter being a Motive to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And therefore alſo upon the ſame ground it follows, <hi>Truſt in the living God, and not in Riches,</hi> (ſo neither in <hi>Learning, Wiſdom, Credit,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>v.</hi> 17. For why? It is the <hi>living God</hi> whom you are to have to do withal for ever. Altho he hath for the preſent given you, and provided <hi>all things in this World richly to enjoy,</hi> (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows there) yet he hath <hi>reſerved himſelf for you</hi> to enjoy in the other World. And it is the <hi>[living God]</hi> in my Text likewiſe, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60376:124"/> from this ground, <hi>That a Man's Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns unto God that gave it,</hi> v. 7.

                     <p>Let me next deal <hi>ſtrictim,</hi> or at down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right blows with you.

As the Murtherer did when he ran to the <hi>City of Refuge</hi> from the attach of the <hi>Avenger of Blood,</hi> (as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. the alluſion is) <hi>a flying for refuge unto Chriſt.</hi> Which eſcape is made by a ſolid, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and over-powring apprehenſion of that eſtate to be ſuch, as that a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing therein, he apprehends he is every moment obnoxious to this Wrath, which drives him unto Chriſt as a Deliverer from that Wrath, joined with a giving a Man's ſelf up to him: Both which, through the Power of the Holy Ghoſt accompanying them, do work a change of Heart and Life in him, an actual turning of the Soul unto God from all Sin to Godlineſs. And until
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60376:125"/> a Man be thus ingrafted into Chriſt, and thereby made a new Creature in him, <hi>All this Wrath,</hi> as Chriſt ſays <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>ult. remains or abides upon him.</hi> Which word <hi>[remains]</hi> imports (as was ſaid) his condition to have been originally, and in it ſelf, and from the beginning, and uninterruptedly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Wrath; until ſaving Faith, which is accompanied with Regeneration and true Repentance, puts the difference. So as there needs no more to be enquired of ſuch a Man, <hi>but what have you to ſay for the alteration of your Eſtate?</hi> without which it is one and the ſame that it was at the firſt; he <hi>continues under Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion until now: Wrath remains.</hi> As we uſe to ſay, <hi>An Outlawry,</hi> a Sentence of Death remains upon a Man till pardoned. He ſays not only that the Wrath of God is coming upon ſuch a Man, (as the Apoſtle's Phraſe is) but it <hi>abides, &amp;c.</hi> the Apoſtle indeed ſays, <hi>it comes,</hi> as in reſpect to the execution <note place="margin">John 8.</note> of it; but Chriſt ſays, <hi>it abides on a Man,</hi> in reſpect of a Man's being bound over unto it, until the Son doth make him free.</p>
                     <p>Then again think with your ſelves, how that this Wrath of God is declared to be <hi>againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of any kind, continued in a way of Diſobedience. And be thy Sins ſmall or great, yet whilſt thou art in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60376:125"/> this Wrath is in their proportion due unto all that ungodlineſs and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in thee, and remains upon thee for them. Firſt, againſt all ungodlineſs, though it be but in deadneſs, averſeneſs unto, and turning aſide from God unto the Creature: whereupon follow Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, Contempts of him, Enmities to him, and thence Omiſſion of Duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and <hi>not glorifying him as God,</hi> as there <hi>ver.</hi> 21. And ſecondly, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs unrepented of and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; the enumeration of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of which you may have in the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29, 30. <hi>being filled with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Fornication, Wickedneſs, Covetouſneſs, Maliciouſneſs, full of Envy, Murther, Debate, Deceit, Malignity, Whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Backbiters, Haters of God, Diſpiteful, Proud, Boaſters, Inventors of evil Things, Diſobedient to Parents, &amp;c.</hi> And to ſtrike thy Heart yet more, think what Sins the Apoſtle more eſpecially ſingleth out, as thoſe for which he ſpecially indigitates that <hi>the Wrath of God cometh upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience, Col.</hi> 3. 5, 6. Even <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry: For which things ſake the Wrath of God cometh upon the Children of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> that is, that live in them in a way of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60376:126"/> Rebellion and Diſobedience unto God.</p>
                     <p>And conſider, they are not Heathens only, whom the Wrath of God is poured forth upon; though ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 6. <hi>Pour out thy Wrath upon the Heathen that have not known thee;</hi> and Pſal. 9. 17. <hi>All the Nations that forget God ſhall be turned into Hell:</hi> But it is alſo thoſe that live under and <hi>obey not the Goſpel;</hi> and thoſe eſpecially. In 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. The Subjects of this Wrath are reduced to theſe two, thoſe <hi>that know not God,</hi> they were theſe Heathens; and <hi>thoſe that obey not the Goſpel,</hi> that is, who profeſſing it, and living under the means of it, even the <hi>Children of the Kingdom,</hi> (as they are called <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 12. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 41.) there <hi>ſhall be gathered out of the Kingdom</hi> (that is, the viſible Profeſſors of Religion in the ſtrictneſs of it) <hi>all things</hi> (that is, Perſons) <hi>that do offend,</hi> and <hi>do Iniquity,</hi> or are <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it.</hi> Thoſe firſt and eſpecially, that have given ſcandal by doing Iniquity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and repented not, and then thoſe that ſecretly <hi>[do Iniquity;]</hi> that are found workers of it in any kind, they ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered (ſays Chriſt) <hi>and caſt them into a Furnace of Fire;</hi> and Hypocrites eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are made the meaſure and ſtandard of all other that are caſt into it, both by Chriſt and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:60376:126"/>
                     <p> But not only theſe, but in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>He that but wanteth the Wedding-Garment;</hi> not the poſitive doers of Iniquity only, but that want true Grace, Sincerity of Faith, and Love unto Jeſus Chriſt; the wanting all thoſe Graces, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. which as a Garment he ſhould have put on (as in thoſe places) that came to ſuch a Wedding, the Wedding of ſo great a Perſon. And when there, he ſays to ſuch an one, Friend; it is an upbraiding Speech, ſuch an one as Chriſt uſed to <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 26. 50. becauſe he had profeſſed himſelf to be a Friend, but is diſcovered to be a falſe and feigned one; <hi>How comeſt thou hither?</hi> here is no room for thee. And though Chriſt is ſaid to ſpy out but one ſuch among that Company, yet it is the caſe of many: For, that the concluſion of that Parable, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. importeth, <hi>Many are called, few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen:</hi> and ſo that one Perſon is profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made but the Inſtance or Example of what Chriſt will do with all others that are ſuch; who will prove many. And it is ſaid that he was ſpeechleſs, or ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as with an Halter (as the Original Word ſignifies) through obſtupefaction of Spirit. Now of this Man, and all other ſuch, Chriſt the King ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Bind him Hand and Foot,</hi> (that he may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60376:127"/> not be able to help himſelf or deliver himſelf) <hi>and cast him into outer Darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> And the true reaſon is, becauſe if Mens Eſtates be found unrenewed or unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, (as this Mans was through want of true Grace) then the Sins of their whole Lives do abide upon their ſcore, and are charged upon them. And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch an one, even the fineſt-ſpun Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, hath Sins enough (if he had no other) in thoſe very deficiencies and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſhort of true and ſpiritual Grace, which he wholly wants. And the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſublimated work of the Spirit, which a Man remaining unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is any way capable of, through heavenly enlightnings, and taſtings of the Powers of the World to come, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up but ſelf only, and the Affections thereof towards ſpiritual things, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being diſcovered, not only that it is a deficient work, and ſhort of true Holineſs at that day: but alſo when all the inward Obliquities, Motives, Ends, Purpoſes, Affections, that are in ſuch Mens Hearts; that were the influencers and guides of their Ways and Actions, are diſcovered, it will be found that they all are matter of Wrath, as truly as their other Sins: And their Perſons will be
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60376:127"/> proved to have continued under the Wrath of God abiding on them, as well as groſſer Sinners. And that there will be the diſcovery of theſe things in ſuch Men, is the genuine ſcope of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>The Word of God</hi> (underſtand it whether of Chriſt, or the Word of Chriſt) <hi>is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow, and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart: Neither is there any Creature</hi> (that is, of the Heart of Man) <hi>that is not manifeſt in his Sight, with whom we have to do.</hi> For unto ſuch Profeſſors among the Jews, as had been enlightned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>chap.</hi> 6. of whom you alſo read up and down in that Epiſtle; and yet ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in real and ſpiritual unbelief, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. of this very Chapter compared with <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 5. is this Paſſage particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly directed, and of them intended.</p>
                     <p>Conſider moreover, that the longer thou goeſt on in this Eſtate, or in thy Sin, the more of <hi>Wrath thou treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Every Moment Sins do add unto that heap. And all thy Sins are barrel'd up in thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as Gun-powder fully dry; and an anſwerable Proportion and Meaſure
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60376:128"/> of Wrath is laid up in God's Heart; and when theſe meet, and that it comes to paſs that the Fire of God's Wrath breaks forth out of his Heart into thine, then thy Soul is blown up in an inſtant, and a Fire kindled that burns for ever in Hell.</p>
                     <p>And meditate alſo how frail thy Life is, how thin and ſlight a Skreen of Fleſh there is betwixt all this Wrath and thy bare Soul; which if worn, or any way ſliced through, the Soul runs out. Nay, that venemous Spider, thy Soul, dwells but in a Cobweb, which if bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or any violence be done it, it inſtantly flies away into the other World.<hi>—Job,</hi> in ſeveral places, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to compare our Lives and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this World unto a Candle or Lamp: Now let the Candle be let alone to burn it ſelf out fairly to its full length, yet ſome laſt but a very little while, and thoſe of the greateſt ſize cannot long. Oh, but how many intervening Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are there, that afore do put it out? The Candle of the <hi>Wicked ſhall be put out,</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction cometh upon them, Job</hi> 21. 17. that is, <hi>ab extrinſeco,</hi> from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. How many Thieves in the Candle, or fatal Accidents do Men meet with, that unawares conſume it? Immoderate Sorrows and Cares ſwale it; Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60376:128"/> like too much Oyl poured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to feed it, choaketh and extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth it; Too much Intention of Mind turns the Flame downwards upon it ſelf, and ſo it evaporates. Often another Mans Breath in ſeaſons of Malignity (which fall out more or leſs every year) blows and puffs it out. A Friends Breath comes in with an infectious Vapour, and throws his Soul out who viſits him: Yea, an unskilful or elſe a miſtaking hand of a Phyſician, who undertakes to ſnuff and brighten it; unwarily clean ſnuffs the Candle out.—Yea, Men ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous <hi>go to the Grave in a moment,</hi> as in the ſame 21. <hi>chapter</hi> of <hi>Job, ver.</hi> 13. Yea, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 15. they <hi>go quick to Hell:</hi> it is an alluſion to <hi>Corah, Dathan, &amp;c. Numb.</hi> 16. 30, 33. of whom 'tis ſaid twice, <hi>They went alive to Hell.</hi> Many die ſo ſuddenly, that they are in Hell in a trice, and as it were ere quite dead. And truly the moſt of Men live in this World like ſilly <hi>Sheep in a Pasture,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Similitude is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 9. 14. <hi>They are</hi>

                        <hi>put into Hell like Sheep,</hi> (ſo ſome:) It notes out their Security in reſpect of that ſlaughter which comes upon them. This Man dies, then that, then another, and they regard it not; even as the Sheep do not, when the Butcher (as his Pleaſure is)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60376:129"/> takes out firſt one, then another, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them to the Shambles, whilſt the reſt feed on; and know not that themſelves are a fatting to the day of Slaughter alſo.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider alſo, what millions of Tranſgreſſions are we guilty of in one Day? Oh then what in thy whole Life? And what a reckoning will the Sins of thy whole Life come to, when every Commandment ſhall bring in their Bills? and that thou haſt to do with a God, who, 1. hath all thy Sins before him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 6. <hi>Behold, it is written afore me, but I will recompence, &amp;c.</hi> 2.

                     <p>The moſt of theſe things hitherto by way of Uſe ſpoken by me, are no other than what <hi>David</hi> himſelf ſpends one whole Pſalm together upon; it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60376:129"/> and ſtyles it <hi>The Meditation of his Heart, verſ.</hi> 3. which cauſed me to entitle that former about <hi>what it is to dye,</hi> a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> rather than an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe;</hi> as I had done that of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. This of <hi>David</hi>'s I ſhall here add, to ſet the deeper ſeal and weight upon all that hath been treated.</p>
                     <p>He begins the Pſalm, and ſhews the moment of theſe matters, though in view but ordinary, with as ſolemn a Preface and Proclamation, calling upon attention and heed hereto, as any where we find in Scriptures. 1. In the firſt verſe he ſummons all the World into a Ring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, <hi>Hear ye this all the People; give Ear all the Inhabitants of the World.</hi> And 2. particulariſeth forth his Auditors into all ſorts of Conditions, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Both low and high, rich and poor together.</hi> For why? what he was to utter to them, did as much concern the one as it did the other, and behoved them all alike to look to; as being that which eſpecially concerned them in reſpect unto their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the other World, how different ſoever their Condition was in this. And 3. he cries up the matter it ſelf, as the greateſt Wiſdom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and a deep myſterious Parable and dark ſaying, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>My Mouth ſhall ſpeak of Wiſdom, and the Meditation of my Heart ſhall be of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:60376:130"/> 
                        <hi>I will incline mine Ear unto a Parable, I will open my dark ſaying upon the Harp.—</hi>Now what ſhould this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be! It was to declare two things, which take up that whole Pſalm.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, how in the ſtyle of a <hi>Be it known to all Men,</hi> (for we have ſeen he publiſheth it to all) he aloud declares, <hi>I for my part am not afraid to die,</hi> and go into that other World. Which confidence of his he greatens by this Suppoſition ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded: That if, when he ſhould come to die, all the Sins of his whole Life were preſented afore his view, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he ſhould not be afraid: thus <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Wherefore ſhould I fear in the days of evil, when the Iniquities of my heels ſhall compaſs me about?</hi> A ſtrange confidence! which yet he found reaſon for from God: For he challengeth all or any thing to bring in reaſon to the contrary; let them all ſay, <hi>[Wherefore ſhould I fear?]</hi> And yet his other Pſalms, as well as his Story, tell us what an infinite number of Sins were upon his ſcore, and how ſenſible he was thereof.—And that this bold Speech of his relates ſpecially to the day of Death, or days wherein he might have cauſe to fear it, (though I will exclude no other times of Trouble, that were yet to come before, in this Life, to be intended
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60376:130"/> by him; which Interpreters wholly carry it unto) that this is his ſcope, I ſhall make appeal to the whole drift of what follows throughout the Pſalm: which concerns the ſtate of wicked Men in their Death, (which I ſhall by and by ſhew:) But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially I argue it from the reference and correſpondency this Speech hath with and to <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>God will redeem my Soul from the Power of the Grave, for he ſhall receive me. Selah.</hi> There you have the reaſon or ground of this his Confidence, which he had at firſt uttered in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as that which he oppoſed unto all <hi>Therefore's</hi> or <hi>Wherefore's</hi> to the contrary; yea, though they ſhould be fetch'd from his very Sins, that might (if any thing) make him afraid. But there in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of his, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. he centers, and landeth this which he had ſo confidently uttered in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. And all the reſt of his diſcourſe that comes between, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently about the oppoſite condition of wicked Men; As that they muſt die, and what their eſtate is in and after Death; all which was but to illuſtrate this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his.</p>
                     <p>He plainly in this <hi>ver.</hi> 5. puts himſelf into the ſuppoſition, as if he were then to die, and as if Death <hi>(the King of terrors, Job</hi> 18. 19.) were ſetting down his ſiege
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60376:131"/> about him, and that <hi>all the Iniquities of his heels</hi> or ways, (which are Deaths ſtrongeſt Forces, <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5, 6.) were as an Army formed up, <hi>encompaſſing him round,</hi> (which out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 12. I have ſhewed to have been his caſe, and the very Metaphor he there alſo uſeth.) But now <hi>David</hi> was ſo ſteeled, as though he placed himſelf (thus aforehand) in the full view and face of all theſe, ſingle and alone in the midſt of them; he yet outdares them all, as the Apoſtle did <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this, for the Lord <hi>will receive my Soul;</hi> which Phraſe of Speech to be the ſame that a dying Saint uſeth, you all know.—And this part of his Speech, <hi>v.</hi> 5. might have come in as comfortable an Uſe as any other, of that former Doctrine, [the <hi>innumerable number of Sins;]</hi> but that this other part that now follows doth properly belong unto what hath been now laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on; and ſo I rather placed both here.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing is, <hi>The oppoſite ſtate of wicked Men</hi> in their Lives, and in relation to their dying, and alſo at and after Death; by which he both illuſtrates and expounds his meaning in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. to be to utter his own bleſſed condition at his Death, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and to that purpoſe it is, he further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates upon the death of wicked Men in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60376:131"/> the reſt of the Pſalm: And which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a kind of Summary of what in the former Meditation I have preſt.</p>
                     <p>During their Lives, <hi>they trust in their Wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multitude of their Riches,</hi> v. 6. and yet they <hi>ſee</hi> (as the word is, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) that they <hi>cannot redeem</hi> their own or others precious Souls from bodily Death, or obtain of God by a <hi>Ranſom,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>live for ever. For he ſees the wiſe Man die like as the Fool,</hi> and ſo <hi>leave their Wealth to others:</hi> Thus in <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. That which therefore (mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Wretches) they relieve themſelves with againſt this, is, <hi>Their inward thought is, that their Houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their Dwelling-places to all Generations: They call their Lands after their own Names, and their Posterity approve their Sayings,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Tho when he dies, he ſhall carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing away, his Glory ſhall not deſcend after him,</hi> &amp;c. And whither goes he when he dies? <hi>His Soul</hi> (ſo 'tis in the Original, and varied in the Margin,) <hi>ſhall go to the Generation of his Fathers,</hi> (to the Company of thoſe Giants of the Old World, from whom <hi>Hell</hi> hath its Name ſo oft in the <hi>Proverbs.)</hi> And where are they all? The <hi>Spirits in Priſon.</hi> So the Apoſtle reſolves us, ſpeaking of the Men of the old World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>And they ſhall never ſee Light</hi>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60376:132"/> or comfort more, ſays the Pſalmiſt. But as for me (ſays <hi>David, v.</hi> 15.) <hi>God ſhall receive me</hi> into the boſom of his Love and Bliſs.—And then again upon their dying, <hi>They are laid as Sheep in the Grave; Death ſhall feed on them,</hi> and prey upon them: The firſt Death upon their bodies in the Grave, the ſecond Death upon their Souls. <hi>And their Beauty ſhall conſume in the Grave:</hi> ſo as at the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as there) of the Reſurrection, the greateſt Perſonages, that have had ſuch a Gleam of Glory to attend them whilſt they lived, accompanied perhaps alſo with dominion over others, ſhall then riſe ſuch ugly ſhabby Death-eaten and Hell-eaten Creatures, (as we uſe to ſay, Moth-eaten) all their Beauty being preyed upon, (that's his word) and conſumed: And ſuch ſhall they appear in Judgment, where the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right (whom they deſpiſed) <hi>ſhall have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>But</hi> (ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) God ſhall redeem my Soul from the power of the Grave: For he ſhall receive me. Selah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for the further illuſtration of all this, and how it relates unto Death, I ſhall only caſt in a manifeſt parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what <hi>David</hi> here had meditated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the condition of wicked Men at Death, with what our Lord himſelf hath ſeconded it withal, in expreſſions fully herewith agreeing, treating of wicked
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60376:132"/> mens dying alſo; <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 16. unto <hi>ver.</hi> 21. 'Tis the Parable of that rich Man, <hi>whoſe Soul was taken away that night.</hi> 1. Says <hi>David, Their inward thought is, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 11. And ſays Chriſt, <hi>He thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf,</hi> ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Whilſt he lived he bleſſed himſelf,</hi> ſo <hi>David ver.</hi> 18. namely, in thoſe his inward Thoughts about his Goods and Poſterity: And the like ſpeaks Chriſt, to be the inward ſpeech and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding himſelf, of his rich Man; <hi>He ſays to his Soul, Soul, thou haſt many Goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe and be merry.</hi> Again 3. of this Man Chriſt ſays, <hi>Thou Fool, this night, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 20. And <hi>David</hi> of his, <hi>This their way is their Folly, ver.</hi> 10. 4. And finally, the reaſon of that their Folly, which both Chriſt and <hi>David</hi> give, do center in one and the ſame: <hi>This Night thy Soul ſhall be required thee, then whoſe ſhall theſe things thou haſt provided be?</hi> Thus Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and <hi>David</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondently, <hi>His Soul ſhall go, &amp;c.

                     <p>Let all Believers from hence learn, how to ſet a due and full value upon that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which they profeſs to expect, and which God hath deſigned to give them.</p>
                     <p>Our great and gracious God, the more to bind and oblige the redeemed of the Sons of Men unto himſelf, hath twiſted their Salvation of a double Cord of Love. 1. A privitive one, ſeen in what they are ſnatcht out of, which is termed <hi>a being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Wrath,</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>A delivering from Wrath,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. 10. <hi>An eſcaping the Damnation of Hell,</hi> Mat. 23. 33. A not (ſo much as) <hi>entring into Condemnation,</hi> John 5. 24. 2. The other a poſitive part, <hi>The Glory to be revealed;</hi> the greatneſs of which no Tongue can utter, or Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. That Bleſſedneſs or Glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on the elect Angels, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhewn them, hath not this privative part of Salvation to greaten it; further then as by way of prevention, in that God
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60376:133"/> upheld them from falling into the Merit or Deſert of it. Whereas we Men are all become guilty afore God, were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under Wrath, <hi>Children of Wrath even as others,</hi> one as well as another, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. And the weight of this he in that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have them put into the Scale whenever they thought of Salvation; <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved:</hi> ſo as with a Note of Remark it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 8.—God hath thus doubled the Mercy of Salvation to us, on purpoſe to make it Salvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; <hi>So great Salvation!</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. which duplication is ſeen in all parts of our Salvation as well as this, as might be largely ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>There are many gracious Saints that have had no Impreſſions of Wrath, no fears and terrors of Hell, ſet upon their Souls in their firſt Humiliation; nay, the Conſideration thereof hath had but ſmall influence into their Hearts by way of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in turning them unto God; but it hath been pure free Love hath taken their Hearts, and ſwallowed up their thoughts. Yet mark what I ſhall ſay unto thee in this Caſe, altho indeed the leſs thou haſt been moved in thy turning to God with ſuch fears or impreſſions of Hell, it be in ſome reſpect the better, for the more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath God's Work been in that reſpect
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60376:134"/> upon thee; and it alſo argues a ſpecial tenderneſs in God's Heart towards thy Soul, to have <hi>reſtrained the Roughneſs of the Eaſt-Wind from blowing on thee,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks. Yet let me withal ſay, That the more any one hath (after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion) taken into conſideration this Wrath, (I do not mean by Terrors, but) by a practical meditation of it, and his own deſert thereof; the more (when joined together with the former, of God's <hi>pure Love)</hi> it will move his Heart to Thankfulneſs to God for ſaving him. And the more thine Heart hath this way been enlarged, the more of God's Love, which thou art either aſſured of, or relieſt upon, muſt needs be greatned to thee; yea, and prove the higher incentive of <hi>Love unto God</hi> again from thee. Whereas on the contrary (that I may give a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) becauſe there ſeemeth to be ſuch an Ingenuity in Grace its working in that firſt reſpect mentioned, that Wrath hath had no influence at all. Hence ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are apt too much to neglect, or not to mind the Conſideration of God's Wrath at all; no not ſo much as in this latter way mentioned; but thinking to keep up an Ingenuity of Love, they entertain not this at all in their Meditations. But ſure this is far more blame-worthy than
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60376:134"/> that other is commendable; and that by how much there comes thereby to be a Loſs, of ſo much and of ſo great a part of God's Love purpoſely thereby deſigned to be ſhewn: (I term it a Loſs, for what is not ſeen, and the Heart conſiders not, nor is ſenſible of, is as if it had not been.) And further I add, that this valuing of God's Love herein ſhewed, at its own full rate in both reſpects, is a matter of greater moment than the working of thy Love to him, in ſo ingenuous and kindly a way, (as thou ſuppoſeſt) without all or any conſideration of Hell or Wrath, can ariſe unto. And this by how much <hi>God's Love to us,</hi> in the full latitude of it, is a thing more precious than <hi>our Love to him.</hi> Of the two, God had rather have us apprehend his Love towards us in the utmoſt extent thereof, than have our Love, or Love from us to him, to work but in that one way of Ingenuouſneſs: yea, and in the iſſue you will all find, that if you join the Conſiderations of both together, they will concur to work an higher Ingenuity of Love, than that other way alone can do.</p>
                     <p>If we will come to <hi>comprehend with all Saints the Heighth, and Depth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Love of God and Christ,</hi> in all the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it, we muſt take that courſe and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60376:135"/> way in our Meditations about it, which God himſelf hath laid out and deſigned on purpoſe to ſet it forth and greaten it unto us by. Which he hath done as well by ſo great a deliverance from ſo great a Wrath due to us, as by conferring ſo rich an Inheritance of Glory upon us. And look as God hath two ſuch vaſt Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, of infinite weight each of them, the one in his right hand, the other in his left, for the manifeſtation of his Love; ſo we ſhould have two Scales in the hand of our Faith to weigh each by: And of the two it may perhaps be hard to ſay which is the more maſſy, that is, in the apprehenſions of ſome of thoſe who have been deeply humbled for Sin, and under ſenſe of Wrath, (tho I think Glory car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it by far.)</p>
                     <p>I obſerve that our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, tho but made a Surety for Sin, and tho it was impoſſible he ſhould be holden of Wrath or any thing he was to ſuffer, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24. yet he doth conſider, as well for his bleſſing God, as alſo to his own Comfort, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 7. and 10. (a Pſalm made wholly of him) and magnify the delivering part of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thine Holy One to ſee Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:</hi> I ſay, he conſiders this as well
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60376:135"/> as the Joy which followed thereon: which yet alſo follows there, v. 11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the Path of Life. In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſs of Joy; at thy right hand there are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> He rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up both, as two diſtinct parts of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhewn in that Salvation of his, which is both the Cauſe and Patern of ours. And that it was to bleſs God for both theſe, which he thus diſtinctly and apart menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his Preface to both, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I will bleſs the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. ſhews. Thus as Man. And there is this further evidence of it, That look as what any one exerciſeth Faith for, and prays for much afore it is obtained, that proportionably he is thankful for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the ſame is ſeen in Chriſt in this very particular. For as we read in that Pſalm, that he exerciſed Faith for this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as well as for that Glory: So in like manner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>That he offered up Prayers and Supplications, with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able [to ſave] him from Death, and was heard in what he feared.</hi> And hence it came to paſs, that we find him after his Deliverance ſo greatly bleſſing God for it. So you read of his praiſing God for the ſame, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. from <hi>v.</hi> 2. to the end, and in expreſs words, <hi>v.</hi> 25. even as well as you may read his Prayer for this Deliverance in the former part of that Pſalm.</p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:60376:136"/>
                     <p> If He, who (but for us and our ſakes) needed no deliverance; then how much more lies this upon us, the Perſons ſaved, and unable to ſave our ſelves, diſtinctly to remember both theſe parts of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with infinite Praiſe and Bleſſing of God's great Name? <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul; and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name, and forget not all</hi> (that is, not any of) <hi>his Benefits,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt in his own Perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1, 2. And what ſort of Benefits were they? it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities; Who redeemeth thy Life from Deſtruction;</hi> there is Salvation from Sin and Hell, the privative part: <hi>Who crowneth thee with Loving-kindneſs and tender Mercies,</hi> (over and above deliverance) <hi>and ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things;</hi> there you ſee alſo is the poſitive part. You might obſerve the very ſame in this 49. Pſalm, <hi>Thou ſhalt redeem me, &amp;c.</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt receive me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all that hath been ſpoken (although you are ſaved from it, yet) look down into Hell a little, as it hath been ſet out to you; And think with your ſelves, Hath God delivered me from ſo great a Death, and given me ſuch a deliverance as this, from a death ſo dreadful and eternal alſo? How would the Devils and Spirits in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon prize an eſcape and deliverance from
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60376:136"/> Wrath preſent and to come, if they could be ſuppoſed capable thereof; yea, if they had no more? A Nobleman or Favourite that hath run into great and high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to have but meer Life given him, how would he value it, though he never ſaw the Court more, nor were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto his Eſtate and Dignities, had he but wherewithal to live? If a Man were in danger to be drowned, and a Rope were thrown him and a Crown, and bidden take his choice; with promiſe, Thou ſhalt be King of all the World, if thou come to ſhore ſafe with the Crown on thy Head: of the two he would in this caſe take hold of the Rope, and refuſe the Crown. And why? becauſe it is Salvation and his Life. But for a Man to be both waſted ſafe to ſhore, and then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving there, to have this Crown beſides! how great Salvation would this be valued, ſtupendous Grace and Love!</p>
                     <p>Theſe things the Saints ſhould conſider chiefly unto two ends and purpoſes;</p>

                     <p n="1">1. To God the Father. It was his part to contrive the whole deſign of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to the end to ſet forth his Love to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60376:137"/> us. And the Scripture ſpreads afore us the Love of the Father herein upon this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration; 1. That he appointed us not to Wrath, (which otherwiſe we ſhould have in the iſſue and execution, by reaſon of Sin fallen under.) 2. That he ordained us to Salvation. You have an expreſs Scripture for both theſe, ſetting forth the Love of God the Father hereby; 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>God hath not appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation.</hi> Here are firſt, two parts of the Mercy vouchſafed, 1. Deliverance from Wrath. 2. Salvation. Then the Love of the Father in his not appointing us to Wrath, (and ſo not to leave us under it) as well as appointing us to Salvation; and both as appointments of God, the one as well as the other.</p>
                     <p>And then in the ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. he provokes them unto thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for this; <hi>But we are bound to give thanks always unto God for you, who hath from the beginning choſen you unto Salvation, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth:</hi> which he ſpeaks with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to what was done to others, <hi>(ver.</hi> 12. compared.) Let me ſpeak to you then in the Apoſtles Language; Oh what thanks are your ſelves then bound (if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gave them for others) to give unto God for your ſelves, to whom God hath
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60376:137"/> given Faith and Holineſs, upon both theſe reſpects?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To Jeſus Chriſt, for that hand which he had in this our Deliverance from Wrath: thus expreſly, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Ye wait for his Son from Heaven, even Jeſus, who delivered us from the Wrath to come.</hi> Here again you have theſe two parts of Salvation ſet together. 1. His coming from Heaven, which they waited for, with hopes of his carrying them thither, as he tells them <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>We ſhall be caught up to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> Then 2. (which the Apoſtle adds with an Emphaſis) <hi>even Jeſus, who delivered us from the Wrath to come.</hi> Take in that too, ſays he, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it not, to endear your Jeſus to you: and for ever know him by this Character, <hi>[It is that Jeſus who delivered you from the VVrath to come.]</hi> It was the Fathers work indeed to appoint and ordain this Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and us unto the benefit of it through Faith; but it was our Jeſus, his Son's work, to effect and accompliſh it; 'twas his Soul that paid for all.</p>
                     <p>And the manner or way how he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from this Wrath, heightens this his Love yet more; for he delivered us from it by being <hi>made himſelf a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 23.</p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:60376:138"/>
                     <p> The ſecond thing I propounded was, <hi>To comfort your Souls</hi> in the conſideration of this Salvation and Deliverance. Thus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 9, 10. for his deliverance, <hi>Therefore [my Heart is glad] my Fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope; for thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, thou wilt ſhew me the path of Life, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> in the 49. Pſalm, which led on to this, doth comfort himſelf alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 15. when of wicked Men he had ſaid, <hi>Like Sheep they are put into Hell,</hi> (as ſome read it) <hi>Death ſhall feed on them:</hi> He then for his own particular comforts himſelf with this, <hi>But God ſhall redeem my Soul from the power of Hell, for he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. having <hi>ver.</hi> 9. ſet before them (as was afore opened) that God had not appointed them to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation, he ſubjoins, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your ſelves together.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>16th</hi> Verſe of the fore-going Chapter (where the Well-head of his Diſcourſe is to be found) he ſhews the extraordinary Care God hath of our [inward Man] to <hi>renew it day by day;</hi> where <hi>Inward Man</hi> is ſtrictly the Soul with its Graces, ſet in oppoſition unto our <hi>Outward Man,</hi> [the Body with its Appurtenances,] which he ſaith <hi>daily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth;</hi> that is, is in a mouldring and decaying condition.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>In this firſt verſe of this fifth Chapter, he meets with this Suppoſition: But what if this outward Man or <hi>earthly Tabernacle</hi> be wholly <hi>diſſolved</hi> and pull'd down, what then ſhall become of this <hi>inner Man?</hi> And he reſolves it thus, <hi>That if it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we have an Houſe, a Building of</hi>

And it is as if he had ſaid, If this inward Man be deſtituted of one Houſe, we have another. God that in this Life was ſo careful over this inner Man, to renew it every day, hath made another more ample proviſion againſt this great Change. It is but its removing from one Houſe to a better, which God hath built. As your ſelves (to ſpeak in your own Language) if Wars ſhould beſet you, and your Country-Houſe were plundered and pull'd down, you would comfort your ſelves with this, I have yet a City-Houſe to retire unto.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the terming the Glory of Heaven, and that as it is beſtowed upon a ſeparate Soul, an <hi>Houſe,</hi> alien from the Scripture-Phraſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. <hi>That when you fail, they may receive you into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Habitations.</hi> Death is a Failing, ('tis your City-Phraſe alſo when a Man proves Bankrupt) a Statute of Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts comes forth then upon your old Houſe, <hi>(Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori)</hi> and upon all you have; and then it is a receiving or entertaining that otherwiſe

                  <p>In this Verſe he gives an wholeſom Caution by the way, and withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates, why he uſed the word <hi>cloathed upon,</hi> in the fore-going Verſe, thus, ſpeaking of the Glory of ſuch a ſeparate Soul, even becauſe it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all our Souls be found cloathed firſt, and renewed with Grace and Holineſs, and not be found naked at our Deaths, that is, not devoid of Grace, and ſo expoſed to Shame and Wrath, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15.</p>

                     <hi>For we that are in this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle do groan, being burthened; not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth Verſe gives a genuine and ſincere Account, why a Chriſtian
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60376:142"/> doth thus groan, and that after diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution it ſelf, in order to this Glory; which he ſets out with an accurate diſtinction of their deſires of diſſolution, in difference from like deſires in all other Men: Firſt, <hi>Negatively,</hi> not for that <hi>being burthened</hi> we deſire to be <hi>uncloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or diſſolved; that is, ſimply for eaſe of thoſe Burthens: nor out of a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our Bodies we now wear, (as their Heathen Wiſe-men and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did, and others do); No. But ſecondly, <hi>Poſitively,</hi> For this, as the top-ground of that Deſire, That we <hi>would be cloathed upon</hi> with that Houſe, (ſpoken of <hi>Verſe</hi> 1. and that ſtill taken in the Sence ſpoken of in the ſecond Verſe) to the end that this mortal ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Life, which the Soul (tho immortal in it ſelf) now leads in the Body, full of Sins, clogg'd with a Body of Death and Miſeries; (each of which hath a Death in it) and ſo it lives but a dying Life; that this Life may be exchanged, yea, ſwallowed up by that which is Life indeed, the only true Life, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God as we are known, and enjoying him: All which, as to our Souls, is truly performed at our Diſſolution; although the final ſwallowing up the Mortality of our Bodies alſo doth yet remain to be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60376:142"/> accompliſhed: which will be done at the latter day, at that Change both of Body and Soul, tho in reſpect of the Body it will be compleated as then more fully.</p>
                  <p>This Interpretation, and the ſuting of all the Phraſes uſed in this <hi>4th</hi> Verſe, to hold good of this Exchange at Death, I cannot, through ſtraitneſs of time, give an account of now: I have lately, and very largely done it elſewhere.</p>

                  <p>There is one word in this Verſe, [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>For this ſelf-ſame thing God hath wrought us,]</hi> which ſerves us as a Clue of Thread drawn through the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60376:143"/> Windings of the former Verſes, to ſhew us, that one and the ſame Individual Glory hath been carried on all along, and ſtill is in this Verſe alſo. So then we ſee where we are.</p>
                  <p>What this <hi>ſelf-ſame thing</hi> ſhould be, ask the firſt Verſe, and it will tell you, it is that <hi>Houſe eternal in the Heavens, a Building of God,</hi> prepared by him againſt the time that this earthly Houſe is diſſolved. Ask the ſecond Verſe, it is the <hi>ſame Houſe we groan to be cloathed upon with,</hi> when the other is pulled down. Ask the fourth Verſe, and more plainly: It is that Life, which ſucceeds this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life the Soul now lives in this Body, and ſwallows up all the Infirmities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And then here it follows, <hi>Even for this ſelf-ſame thing,</hi> &amp;c. So then, if the Glory of the ſeparate Soul be the Subject of any of theſe Verſes, then of all, and ſo of this Verſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>And to be ſure it cannot be that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way of entrance into Glory, by ſuch a ſudden Change, both of Soul and Body into Glory at once, without diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſhould be the ſelf-ſame thing here aimed at. For it was not the Lot of any of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, of whom the Holy-Ghoſt here ſpeaks this, <hi>[He hath wrought us for this thing,]</hi> that they ſhould
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60376:143"/> be in that manner changed, and ſo enter into Glory: but the contrary. For they all, and all Saints ſince for theſe 1600 years, have <hi>put off their Tabernacles</hi> by Death, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, and ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (or Holy Ghoſt) foreſeeing, as the Phraſe is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. this change would be their fate, would not have uttered this of them, <hi>[God hath wrought us for this]</hi> whom he knew God had not deſigned thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it that thoſe groaning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſpoken of in the foregoing verſes, 2, 3, 4. is <hi>[that ſelf-ſame thing]</hi> here (as ſome would) for indeed as <hi>Muſculus</hi> well: If the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>He that hath wrought this thing in us, &amp;c.</hi> that Expreſſion might have carried it to ſuch a Senſe: But he ſaith, <hi>He that wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing:</hi> And ſo 'tis not that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Glory in us is ſpoken of: But <hi>us, our ſelves and Souls as wrought for that Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be asked, what is the ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſcope of theſe words, as touching this Glory of the Soul? The anſwer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, It is to give the rational part of this Point, or demonſtrative Reaſons to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to Believers, That indeed God hath
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60376:144"/> thus ordained and prepared ſuch a Glory afore the Reſurrection. And it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Look into your own Souls, and conſider God's dealings with you hitherto, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the operation of his hands.

This is his very deſign, <hi>He that hath wrought us</hi> (that is, our Souls) <hi>for this very thing, is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides the evidence the work gives, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is alſo over and above the earneſt of the Spirit given to your Souls now whilſt in your Bodies, in Joy, full of Glories of the ſame kind (as Earneſts are) of what fulneſs of Glory they are both capable of then, and ſhall be filled with, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from your Bodies, <hi>Who hath [alſo] given us [the earneſt] of the Spirit.</hi>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60376:144"/> he had been treating of: and ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Demonſtrations run often upon Harmony and Congruity of one Divine Thing or Truth kiſſing another.

                  <p>There is a third point to be ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and that is, It is <hi>the Intereſt of all three Perſons:</hi> Which how clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced out of the Text, will appear, when I have diſpatched theſe former Doctrines.</p>

                     <p>That it is a ſtrong Argument, that God hath provided a Glory for ſeparate Souls hereafter, That <hi>He hath wrought us,</hi> and wrought on us a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> in this Life.</p>
                     <p>Ere the Reaſon of this will appear, I muſt firſt open three things, natural to the words: which will ſerve as materials, out of which to make forth that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that the thing here ſaid to be wrought, is Grace or Holineſs; which is a preparation unto Glory. (1.) Grace is the Work. And ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. termed, <hi>The good Work.</hi> A frame of Spirit, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to good works:</hi> Eph. 2. 10. <hi>We are his Workmanſhip, created unto good Works.</hi> The Text here ſays, <hi>Who hath wrought us:</hi>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:60376:145"/> There ſimilarly, <hi>We are his Workmanſhip.</hi> And (2.) Secondly, this Work is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to Glory. For, for one thing to be firſt wrought in order to another, is a preparation thereunto. Now ſaith the Text, <hi>He hath wrought us for this thing;</hi> and Rom. 9. 23. it is <hi>in terminis, The Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared to Glory;</hi> which was by working Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Even us whom he hath called.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Who hath made us meet to be partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light:</hi> Meet, by making us Saints. So then, <hi>Had prepared, Hath made meet</hi> is all one with, <hi>Who hath wrought us for this thing.</hi> Here</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, what is the principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wrought upon, or prepared and made meet for Glory. 'Tis certainly the Soul, in Analogy to the Phraſe here. We uſe to ſay (when we ſpeak of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) <hi>Since my Soul was wrought on.</hi> And though the Body is ſaid to be ſanctified, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 23. yet the immediate Subject is the Soul; and that primitively, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: the Body by derivation from the Soul. And hence it is, the Soul (when a Man dies) carries with it all the Grace by inherency: <hi>All Fleſh is Graſs which withers;</hi> that is, the Body with all the appurtenances, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60376:146"/> But you, having <hi>purified your Souls, being born again of incorruptible Seed</hi> (our Bodies are made of corruptible Seed, which is the oppoſition there) <hi>by the Word of God, which lives and abides for ever: And this is the Word</hi> (he ſays he means) <hi>which by the Goſpel is preached</hi> (every day) <hi>unto you, ver.</hi> 25. and by preaching is engrafted in your Souls, <hi>purifying [your Souls] ver.</hi> 22. In no other Subject doth that Word (as preached) for ever abide. For the Body rots, and in the Grave hath not an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but a relative Holineſs, (ſuch as the Epiſcopal Brethren would have to be in Churches conſecrated by them) becauſe once it was the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, who dwells in us.</p>
                     <p>And that it is the Soul the Apoſtle hath here in his Eye, in this Diſcourſe of his in my Text, as that which he intends the Subject here wrought upon, appears, if we conſult the Well-head of his Diſcourſe about the Soul, which is the 16. <hi>ver.</hi> of the 4. <hi>Chap. Our inward Man</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is renewed, &amp;c.</hi> (there is your wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here) <hi>whilſt the outward</hi> (the Body) <hi>periſheth.</hi> Which Soul, in being call'd <hi>the inward Man,</hi> connotates at once both Grace and the Soul conjunct together, and diſtinct from the Body, as well as from Sin and Corruption.

So working upon it, in order to this ſelf-ſame thing, continually. Unto which Words there, theſe here have an evident aſpect; yet ſo, as that time of working is but during this Life: For it is whilſt the outward Man is mouldring, and that <hi>by Afflictions, which during this moment work an eternal weight of Glory,</hi> ver. 17. and that is expreſly ſaid to be <hi>but this preſent time,</hi> Rom. 8.

                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, I come to the Argument to be raiſed out of them, to prove the Point in hand.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that Grace or Holineſs, becauſe they are immediately wrought in the Soul, that therefore when the Body dies the Soul ſhall be taken up into Life. That this is a meet and congruous Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, the Scripture it ſelf owns, and ſeems ſo to pitch the reaſon of it, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10, 11. <hi>And if Chriſt be in you, the Body is dead, becauſe of Sin: but the Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs. But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead dwell in you; he that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> He gives an account of what is to become hereafter, both of the Bodies and Souls of them in whom Chriſt is. (1.) Firſt, for the Body that is condemned to die, <hi>The Body is dead becauſe of Sin.</hi> By Body I underſtand the ſame which he in the <hi>11th</hi> Verſe terms the <hi>mortal Body to be raiſed up;</hi> which (ſays he) <hi>is dead,</hi> that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to die; as one ſentenced to Death you term a <hi>dead Man.</hi> And this <hi>[becauſe</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:60376:148"/> 
                     <hi>of Sin.]</hi> It was meet that that firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>dying</hi> ſhould have ſome effect to evidence the Truth of God therein. Only God is favourable in his Ordination in this, that he arreſteth but the Body, the leſs principal Debtor; but that (to be ſure) ſhall pay for it: <hi>It is appointed to all Men once to die,</hi> even for Men that are in Chriſt, as this place of the <hi>Romans</hi> hath it. Then (2.) follows, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the Soul of ſuch an one when the Body dies. <hi>[But]</hi> ſays he, (ſpeaking by way of exception, and contrary fate too,) <hi>The Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The Spirit is the Soul in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to the Body; this, when the Body dies, is <hi>Life:</hi> He ſays not <hi>Living</hi> only, or immortal, but is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up into Life: And why? <hi>becauſe of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is Chriſt's Image; and ſo preſerves, and by God's ordination upon dying, elevates the Soul, which is the immediate and original Subject of it, (which is the Point in hand.) For this thing it is, God hath wrought it. But then becauſe the Query would be, Shall this Body for ever remain dead, <hi>becauſe of</hi> (this firſt) <hi>Sin,</hi> and bear this Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for ever? No: Therefore (3.) he adds, <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal Bodies.</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:60376:148"/> So at laſt, and then bringing both Body and Soul together unto compleat Glory.</p>
                  <p>And the congruity of Reaſon that is for this appointment is obſervable, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>As by Man came Death, ſo by Man came alſo the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Dead.</hi> For that Sin that condemned us to this Death, we had from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by bodily Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the channel or means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, who was (as other) <hi>Father of our Fleſh.</hi>

                  <p>The Arreſt therefore goes forth againſt the Body, which we had from that <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe of that Sin, conveyed by means of our Bodies: for tho I muſt not ſay, the Body defiles the Soul, or of it ſelf is the immediate Subject of Sin; yet the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Means or Channel, through which it comes down, and is derived unto us, is the Generation of our Bodies. The Body therefore congruouſly pays for this, and the Death thereof is a Means to let Sin out of the World, as the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it was a means to bring Sin in: But an holy Soul or Spirit, which is the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God, having now true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> communicated to it, and abiding in it; and being not only the immediate Subject thereof, but further, the firſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60376:149"/> and original Subject, from and by which it is derived unto the Body; the Womb, into which that immortal Seed was firſt caſt, and in which the inward Man is formed, and in reſpect of a conſtant abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in which it is that Seed is termed incorruptible. Hence therefore ſays God of this Soul, <hi>[It is Life]</hi> It ſhall live when this Body dies. There is nothing of Chriſt's Image, but is ordained to abide for ever. <hi>Charity never fails.</hi> His <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>

This, as a Foundation of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts of this firſt Reaſon out of this one Scripture, thus directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly holding this forth.</p>

                  <p>I come (2.) to the Argumentation it ſelf, which ariſeth out of theſe things laid together. (1.) That the Soul is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subject of Grace. (2.) The firſt and primitive Suſceptive thereof. (3.) And it ſelf is alone and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly capable of Glory, which Grace is a preparation to. And (4.) that God afore our Deaths hath wrought all of Grace he intends to work, in preparation
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60376:149"/> to Glory. Out of all theſe a ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doth ariſe, That ſuch a Soul upon Death ſhall be admitted unto Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and not be put to ſtay till the time of the Reſurrection, when both Soul and Body ſhall be joined again together. And that this holdeth a juſt and meet conveniency upon each, or at leaſt, all theſe grounds when put together.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider the Soul as the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Subject of this working and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Glory. Hence therefore this will at leaſt ariſe, That the Inherency or Abiding of this Grace wrought in this Soul, depends not upon its conjunction with the Body; but ſo as it remains as an everlaſting and perpetual Conſerver of that Grace ſtampt on it; yea, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it all with it ſelf, as a rich Treaſure innate unto it wherever it goes, when ſeparate from the Body. I ſay, it either hath in it, or appertaining unto it, all that hath been wrought for it, either in it, or by it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord: [And their Works do follow them:]</hi> They go to Heaven with them, and after them. And in what Subject elſe is it, that the <hi>Seed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>of God remains incorruptible,</hi> or the <hi>Word of God abides for ever?</hi> Or how elſe comes that Saying to be performed,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60376:150"/> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 17. <hi>He that doth the Will of God, endures for ever?</hi> Having therefore all theſe Riches by it, and as complete (as here it ſhall be,) meet it is it ſhould partake the benefit thereof, and live upon them now when it is ſingle and alone, and in its Widow's condition. And it is an opportune ſeaſon, that by a Glory given it for that Holineſs, this ſhould now appear, That it was the Soul which was the ſole intrinſick and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Receptive of all this Holineſs. This is the firſt. Add alſo,</p>
                  <p>Secondly; Its being the firſt and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Subject of Holineſs, from vhich it is derivatively in the Body. Meet it was this Soul ſhould not be deferred, till <note place="margin">Magis conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus per prius fuit culpa &amp; meritum, prius eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am vel pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niantur vel praemien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> cont. <hi>Gent.</hi> lib. 4. cap. 19 § 3.</note> the Appurtenance of it be united to it, but be ſerved firſt, and admitted into that Glory ordained; and by having it ſelf firſt poſſeſſion given of that Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Body might in its ſeaſon be admitted derivatively thereinto from it, after that renewed Union with it by the Reſurrection. Reaſon good, that look as in Priority, Grace, the preparation unto Glory, was wrought; ſo, in that Order of Priority, Glory it ſelf ſhould be communicated. And therefore ſeeing its Fate is to abide a while alone, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt to enjoy, and drink both the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60376:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> Juice and Fruit of that Vine it is the Root of.</p>
                  <p>And (3.) it being in it ſelf, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, as immediatly capable of this Glory, as when it ſhall be again united to the Body: For what is the Eſſential of Glory, the Subſtance of that Life that ſwallows up all, but (as we ſaid on <hi>v.</hi> 4.) God's immediate Preſence, and our knowing him face to face, as we are known. Now of this the Apoſtle doth in theſe 6, 7, and 8 <hi>Verſes,</hi> expreſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, That the ſeparate Soul is not only capable thereof, but that it then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to enjoy it: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>we are always confident, knowing, that whilſt we are in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord; (for we walk by Faith, not by Sight.) We are confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Where to be <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>live by Sight,</hi> is expreſly made the Privilege of a Soul abſent from the Body; which can mean no other State, than that of the Soul between the Death of the Body, and the Reſurrection. For whilſt it is <hi>preſent in the Body</hi> afore Death, it is <hi>abſent from the Lord;</hi> and when it ſhall be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord,</hi> after the Reſurrection, it ſhall not then be any more <hi>abſent from</hi>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:60376:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                     <hi>the Body.</hi> This Conjunction therefore of <hi>abſent from the Body, and preſent with the Lord,</hi> falls out in no State elſe, but only in that Interim or ſpace of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. Let us withal view this Place in the Light, (by bringing the one to the other) which that Paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. doth caſt upon it: <hi>For now we ſee through a Glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known. [To ſee as in a Glaſs darkly]</hi> there, is to <hi>[walk by Faith]</hi> here: But to <hi>ſee face to face, and to know God as we are known,</hi> (ſo there) is all one; and to attain to ſight, and be in Chriſt's preſence (here.) And to be ſure, the Body is in no eſtate whatever capable of knowing God, as we are known of him: None durſt ever affirm that. For beſides that, the Spiritual Knowledg of God is proper to an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Nature: Further, ſo to know God, as God knows us, and ſo to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the Similitude of God's Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is not communicable to the Body. We may as well dare to affirm God himſelf to be a Body, as that our Bodies are capable of ever being raiſed up thus to know God. Hence therefore whether the Soul be out of the Body, as after Death; or ſo in the Body, as it ſhall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60376:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> be after the Reſurrection; yet ſtill it is the Soul that is immediately alone capable of that Sight and Knowledg of God. And therefore ſeeing it depends not on the Body, it is as well capable of it afore the Reſurrection without the Body, as after the Reſurrection in the Body.</p>
                  <p>Only this muſt be added, That whilſt indeed the Soul is at home in this Body, (this earthly Tabernacle) it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this Sight of the Glory of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to continue in the Body, and enjoy it; for it would crack this earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> And altho <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Stander-by, was an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearer, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> and an Eye-witneſs (by way of Revelation and Viſion) of what the Spirits of Juſt Men in Glory do enjoy: Even as on the contrary, the Angels are often Standers-by on Earth, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of us, what is therein done, (as the Phraſe is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 7.) yet he was not eſtated into it, or admitted a Poſſeſſor thereof himſelf, no more than Angels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthly eſtate; and therefore could not ſay, whether the Revelation vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed him, might not be in the Body as well as out of it: Whereas God had otherwiſe long ſince peremptorily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that Queſtion, <hi>That no Man could</hi>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:60376:152"/> 
                     <hi>ſee God, and live;</hi> that is, at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this Body, and ſee him face to face. And <hi>Paul</hi> here in my Text alſo determines it, That <hi>whilſt we are at home in the Body,</hi> (as now) <hi>we are abſent from the Lord.</hi> They are two incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible Eſtates. But ſtill when that which thus lets, (this Body) is taken out of the way, the Soul it ſelf is ſufficiently capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as truly as ever it ſhall be.</p>

                  <p>But if this Argument from theſe be yet judged not home enough, but ſhort: Then let us in the fourth place add what Force the third Premiſe will give to it, concerning the Time of God's working on us, to drive all cloſer home; namely, That God hath wrought upon the Soul in this Life, all that ever he means to work, by way of Preparation for Glory. <hi>For this thing God [hath wrought us]</hi> which tho it might with the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sub-Arguments that now ſhall follow, be made an Argument alone; yet I chooſe to caſt it into this Total, to make the whole the more ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (4.) gather up the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations thus: If the Soul be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and firſt Subject of Grace, which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60376:152"/> is a preparation to Glory, and <hi>capable</hi> of this Glory, when out of the body; <hi>And God, the great Agent or Worker, hath wrought all that ever he means to work in it,</hi> this way, by way of preparation to Glory: Then, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid in the caſe of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gentiles to Baptiſm, <hi>What ſhould hinder</hi> that theſe Souls ſhould not be <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 10 47.</note> inſtantly, when out of their bodies? If indeed, as the Papiſts, and corrupted Jews and Heathens have feigned, there were any work to be after wrought, a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or the like; Then a <hi>Demurre</hi> or <hi>Caveat</hi> might be yet put in, to ſuſpend this their admiſſion into Glory: But the contrary being the truth, then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the ſtrength of the <hi>Argument</hi> from this latter, ſuperadded to the reſt, ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two ſtrong Grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if we conſider what is <hi>common</hi> to God in this with all other, but <hi>ordinary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Efficients</hi> or Workers, that are intent upon their Ends, which muſt be given to him, the only <hi>Wiſe All-powerful God,</hi> (who is here ſaid, as <hi>an Efficient,</hi> to <hi>work</hi> us <hi>for this</hi> End.) When any ordinary Efficient hath brought his Work to a period, and done as much to ſuch or ſuch an End as he means to do, he delays not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his End, and bring it to execution; unleſs ſome over-powring impediment do
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60376:153"/> lie in his way to it. If you have beſtowed long &amp; great Coſt upon any of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to fit and prepare them for any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> ſuppoſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Calling; Do you then let theſe your Children lie <hi>Truants, idle,</hi> and <hi>aſleep at home,</hi> and not put them forth to that which you at firſt deſigned <hi>that</hi> their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation</hi> unto? Will you ſuffer them (in this caſe) to loſe their time, <hi>Do you know how to do good to your Children, and doth not God?</hi> We ſee God doth thus in <hi>Nature.</hi> We ſay, when the <hi>Matter</hi> is as <hi>fully prepared</hi> as ever it ſhall be, that <hi>the forms enter without delay:</hi> Now Grace is expreſly termed a <hi>preparation to</hi> Glory. Alſo God doth obſerve this in working of <hi>Grace</hi> it ſelf, when the Soul is as fully humbled and emptied, and thereby <hi>prepared for the Lord</hi> by <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> Miniſtry, as he means to prepare it; the <hi>work</hi> of juſtifying <hi>Faith</hi> preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. In all his Diſpenſations of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> or <hi>Mercies,</hi> he obſerves the ſame. When mens <hi>ſins</hi> are at <hi>full</hi> (as of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites)</hi> he ſtays not a moment to <hi>execute Judgment:</hi> So in anſwering the <hi>Faith</hi> of his People waiting on him for <hi>Mercies.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> it is for <hi>Glory; I have glorified thee on earth,</hi> (the only place and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our glorifying God) <hi>I have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work thou gaveſt me to do: And now</hi>
                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:60376:153"/> (what now, and preſently now remains there, follows) <hi>Glorifie me &amp;c.</hi> Thus ſpake Chriſt our Pattern.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is <hi>this</hi> further falls out, in this <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Condition,</hi> of ſuch a Soul, as doth indeed call for this out of a kinde of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and not of <hi>congruity</hi> only. For whereas by God's Ordination there are <hi>two ways</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with him, and <hi>but two,</hi> unto all Eternity; either that of <hi>Faith,</hi> which we have at <hi>preſent;</hi> and of <hi>Sight,</hi> which is for <hi>hereafter.</hi> Into theſe <hi>two,</hi> the Apoſtle reſolves all God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations to us, ver. 7. of this Chapter, <hi>We walk by faith,</hi> (namely, in this life) <hi>not by ſight.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>[Now] we ſee in a glaſs, [Then] face to face.</hi> Theſe two <hi>[Now]</hi> and <hi>[Then]</hi> do divide the Diſpenſations for Eternity of time to come. The like in <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 1. 8. <hi>In whom though [Now] you ſee him not,</hi> (as you one day ſhall) <hi>yet believing.</hi> If therefore when the Soul goes out of the Body, <hi>that way</hi> of communion with God by <hi>Faith utterly ceaſeth</hi> 
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8, 13.</note>, that door and paſſage will be quite ſhut up; God having <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 11. John 6. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>fulfilled all the work of faith (The work of God) with power,</hi> that ever <hi>he</hi> intendeth: Then ſurely <hi>Sight</hi> muſt ſucceed according to God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or otherwiſe this would inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60376:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> follow, That the Soul would be for that interim, until the Reſurrection, cut off from all communion with God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; having yet all its acquired holineſs of Sanctification abiding in it, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs accompanying of it all that while. Look therefore as a <hi>Childe</hi> hath <hi>two,</hi> and but two <hi>wayes</hi> of <hi>living,</hi> and when the <hi>one ceaſeth,</hi> the <hi>other ſucceeds,</hi> or Death would follow: In the <hi>Womb</hi> it <hi>lives</hi> by <hi>nouriſhment</hi> from the <hi>Navel,</hi> without ſo much as <hi>breathing</hi> at the mouth: but it no ſooner comes into the world, but that former means is cut off, and it liveth <hi>by breath,</hi> and taking in nouriſhment by the mouth, or it muſt inſtantly die. So ſtands the <hi>caſe</hi> with the <hi>Soul</hi> here between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sight:</hi> So that we muſt either affirm, That the Souls dies to all ſpiritual actings and communions with God until the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which thoſe Scriptures ſo much do contradict, <hi>He that believeth hath eternal life, &amp;c. and ſhall never</hi> (no not for <note place="margin">Joh. 9. 51. &amp; 11. 26.</note> a moment) <hi>die;</hi> (and in thoſe Promiſes it is not ſimply a ſluggiſh Immortality, but to live, and act, and enjoy God (which is our life) muſt needs be meant:) Or we muſt on the other ſide affirm, That the life of <hi>Faith</hi> ceaſing, and God yet having that way wrought all that ever he intendeth, That <hi>then, Sight of God</hi> face
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60376:154"/> to face muſt come in its place: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Apoſtle in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. affirms, in ſaying, ver. 10. <hi>When that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is come, then that which is but in part is done away.</hi> There is not an utter ceaſing of the imperfect, and then an interval or long ſpace of time to come between; and <hi>then,</hi> that which is perfect is to come: but the <hi>imperfect</hi> is done away by <hi>the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coming</hi> of that which is thus perfect. And in the 12th Verſe he explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That the imperfect is this our <hi>ſeeing [Now] in a glaſs darkly,</hi> that is, by <hi>Faith;</hi> and that perfect, to be that <hi>ſeeing God face to face,</hi> as that which preſently entertains us in that other world. Nay, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle admits not ſo much as a <hi>moment</hi> of ceſſation, but ſayes, That <hi>the imperfect is done away,</hi> (ver. 10.) and <hi>vaniſheth,</hi> (as ver. 8.) by the <hi>coming in of the perfect</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: and ſo the imperfect, namely, <hi>[Faith]</hi> is <hi>ſwallowed up</hi> of the <hi>perfect,</hi> namely, <hi>[Sight.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then further, if we thus grant (as we muſt) this <hi>ſeparate Soul</hi> to have this <hi>ſight,</hi> or nothing now left it, to enjoy God any way by; Then it can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Glory</hi> it is admitted unto: For, the <hi>ſight of God face to face, and to know as we are known,</hi> is the very eſſence of Glory, as it differs from <hi>Faith.</hi> Neither
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60376:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> is <hi>that ultimate Enjoyment,</hi> or happineſs in God, which <hi>Souls</hi> ſhall have after the Reſurrection, any other (in Name or Thing) than <hi>the ſight of God,</hi> as it is thus diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Faith;</hi> although it ſhall be then raiſed and intended unto far higher degrees of Perfection.</p>

                  <p>And for a Concluſion of this firſt Point, that which follows in that place lately ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Receiving the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls,</hi> may as fitly ſerve for the confirmation of <hi>all theſe latter</hi> fore-going Notions, as to any other ſenſe Interpreters have affixed.</p>
                  <p>I am aware how theſe words, <hi>Receiving the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls,</hi> are interpreted of that <hi>joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and full of glory,</hi> which the Verſe afore had ſpoken, that many Saints through <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> do in this life enjoy, as being <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation imperfect,</hi> and the <hi>earneſt</hi> of it in the ſame kind, and ſo a part of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of Faith received in <hi>hand</hi> (as we ſay) or aforehand, and vouchſafed over and above the ordinary way of <hi>living</hi> by Faith. This interpretation I no way gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, nor will go about to exclude: for I know it doth conſiſt with that other I am
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60376:155"/> about to give, and is ſubordinate to it: (And I have learned to take the moſt comprehenſive ſence the holy Ghoſt may be ſuppoſed to aim at in any Scripture.) But if this ſence ſhould <hi>directly</hi> alone ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet by conſequence, and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, it doth ſtrongly argue the Point in hand. For if whilſt Faith <hi>continues,</hi> God is pleaſed to vouchſafe the Soul, through <hi>believing,</hi> ſuch joys; much more when <hi>Faith ceaſeth,</hi> he will vouchſafe the ſame Soul a fuller enjoyment of himſelf at the ending of Faith: For why elſe are theſe preſent joys termed <hi>Salvation,</hi> and that as diſtinct from that right to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which otherwiſe <hi>Faith</hi> at all times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates us into, but for this, that theſe joys are an entrance into, and a taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Glory, over and above what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Faith giveth? And therefore they have the name given them, as being the <hi>earneſt</hi> of the ſame kind, unto that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fum is to be paid (as in all Contracts it uſeth to be) at the end of that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance on one part: which end is when <hi>Faith ends.</hi> And ſo that is made the <hi>ſet Date</hi> or time when this full payment is to begin, which this <hi>earneſt</hi> aforehand bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God unto.</p>
                  <p>And it were hard to ſuppoſe, that God would give ſuch a part of theſe joys, even
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60376:156"/> whilſt <hi>Faith continues,</hi> for ſo long a time as until the Reſurrection, and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw all communication of himſelf both in Joy and <hi>Faith</hi> alſo. But I leave the proſecution of this Argument, till I come to thoſe words, <hi>Who hath alſo given us the earneſt of the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>I alſo know, that by this phraſe, <hi>The ſalvation of our ſouls,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> being the eminent part of man, is often in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> put for the <hi>whole perſon.</hi> And I muſt not deny but that ultimately it is intended here, it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf to the whole of <hi>Salvation</hi> firſt, and laſt after Faith ended. Which ſenſe on the other hand many interpreters are for.</p>
                  <p>I only contend for this, That the <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul</hi> is intended alſo of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which falls out in the midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe joys <hi>(the earneſt)</hi> in this life, and that ultimate Salvation at the Reſurrection, that is the Salvation of the Soul, whilſt ſeparate, as being the next. It hath a weight in it, that <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> ſhould ſo often be ſaid to be of the <hi>ſoul</hi> by Chriſt himſelf, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man to gain the whole World</hi> (and ſo provide for his body) <hi>and loſe his own Soul?</hi> And again, in ſpeaking of the Soul as conſidered apart from the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60376:156"/> Body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Fear not them that are able to kill but the body, and are not able to kill the ſoul.</hi> But that which is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct to my purpoſe; it is obſervable, that this our Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould chooſe to uſe in this Epiſtle, more than any other Apoſtle, this phraſe of <hi>[Soul]</hi> in relation to Salvation, either as being the <hi>eminent</hi> ſubject, and ſometimes as the <hi>ſingle</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation:</hi> So in this Chapter, <hi>You have purified your ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. as the immediate ſuſceptive of the <hi>incorruptible ſeed</hi> (as was obſerved.) Then again, in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Abſtain from fleſhly luſts which war [against the Soul]</hi> and, 8. 25. <hi>Ye are returned to the Biſhop of your Souls.</hi> Which he ſpeaks as being the eminent part, and (upon ſeparation from the body) the ſpecial charge he hath paſtoral care of. And more directly to our purpoſe, ch. 4. laſt v. he exhorts them when they come to die, <hi>to commit their ſouls to God,</hi> as then being to be ſeparate from their bodies. Now it were hard to think that this Salvation to come ſhould bear the title and name of the <hi>ſalvation of the ſoul</hi> in this and other Scriptures; and <note place="margin">Heb. 10. v. laſt. Jam. 5. v. laſt.</note> that yet when this Soul ſhall in the other World come to ſubſiſt for a long time ſingle and alone, and then be properly and without figure: A <hi>meer ſoul</hi> without a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60376:157"/> body, a <hi>loneſome ſoul:</hi> That during that ſtate it ſhould not be the ſubject of this Salvation, and ſo intended here, when more properly and literally, if ever, it is <hi>the ſalvation of the Soul.</hi> And it would be yet more ſtrange, that the phraſe, <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul,</hi> ſhould be wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto that eſtate of the Soul, when remitted to the body at Reſurrection, and <hi>onely</hi> unto that. And that word, the <hi>ſoul,</hi> ſhould ſerve onely ſynecdochically as a part put to ſignifie the whole man, as then it is to be raiſed up: but eſpecially, it were ſtrangeſt of all, if it ſhould be confined and limited in this place of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> wherein this <hi>ſalvation of the ſoul</hi> is ſet forth, for the comfort of ſuch as were to lay down their <hi>tabernacles</hi> of their bodies <hi>for Chriſt</hi> (as this <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf in the next Epiſtle,) and whoſe faith was then to ceaſe with their lives, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations therefore he would in this caſe certainly pitch upon that ſalvation of the ſoul next, which is this of the <hi>ſoul ſeparate.</hi> To confirm all which,</p>
                  <p>That which further invited me to this place, was this phraſe <hi>[The end of your Faith]</hi> eſpecially upon the conſideration that he ſpeaks it unto <hi>ſuch Chriſtians,</hi> who in theſe times were (as he foretells, ch. 4. ver. 4.) ſhortly to be martyred, and at
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60376:157"/> preſent were ſorely <hi>tried</hi> (v. 7. of this Chapter) and in the laſt verſe of the fourth, he thereupon inſtructeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to <hi>commit their ſouls</hi> (when they die) <hi>to be kept by God:</hi> And ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a proper and literal ſence, <hi>this ſalvation of their ſouls</hi> is in all reſpects ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>The end of their Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that it is the next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate event that Faith ends and determines in, as Death is ſaid to be the <hi>end of life:</hi> So noting forth, that when Faith ends, this Salvation of the Soul begins and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it. <hi>The end</hi> of a thing ſignifies the immediate event, iſſue, period thereof. As of wicked men it is ſaid, <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction, Phil.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. laſt v. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy and unbelief are ſaid to be a <hi>drawing back unto perdition.</hi> And on the contrary, there Faith is termed a <hi>believing to the ſalvation of the Soul:</hi> And both note out the final event &amp; onſequent of each, and <hi>ſalvation of the ſoul to be the end of faith,</hi> when men continue and go on to believe, until their faith arrive at, and attaineth this Salvation of the Soul. To this ſence alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>You have your fruit in holineſs,</hi> and the <hi>[end] everlaſting life.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going verſes celebrated the fruits and workings of their faith in this life, as in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60376:158"/> ſupporting them gloriouſly under the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt trials, v. 7. and then ſometimes filling their hearts with <hi>joy unſpeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> v. 8. he here at laſt concludeth with <hi>what</hi> will be the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>iſſue</hi> of it in that other life, when faith it ſelf ſhall ceaſe; and what it is that then they ſhall receive, <hi>Receiving</hi> (after all this) <hi>the end of your faith, the ſalvation of your ſouls,</hi>

                  <p>That nothing may be wanting in this laſt place cited, to make up all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in the foregoing Sections inſiſted on: So it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth further plainly inſinuate, That this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (here) conſiſteth in the Sight and Viſion of Chriſt, (which was one Particular afore-mentioned) accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Joy unſpeakable, and glorious.</hi> The Coherence (if obſerved) makes this forth clearly: For whereas in the Verſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60376:159"/> immediately foregoing, he had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their preſent State of Faith by this, <hi>Whom [now] though you ſee not, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, rejoice with Joy unſpeakable, and glorious.</hi> That <hi>[Now] you ſee not,</hi> (in this Life) is ſet in oppoſition, and carries a promiſe with it of a <hi>time to come,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſhould ſee, even as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 33. &amp; 36. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Whither I go, I [Now] ſay to you, ye cannot come; but thou ſhalt follow me [AFTERWARDS].</hi> So here <hi>[NOW] believing,</hi> (which is the Principle at the preſent which you live upon) <hi>you ſee him not;</hi> but when the <hi>end</hi> of your faith ſhall come, you ſhall then ſee him; and in this it is conſiſteth the <hi>ſalvation of your ſoul.</hi> So that ſtill it carries on what I have afore ſpoken unto, That when <hi>Faith</hi> ceaſeth, <hi>Sight</hi> cometh; yea, <hi>perfects</hi> and <hi>ſwallows</hi> it up as was ſaid even now, out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>And let me add this, That the Apoſtle on purpoſe doth bring the mention of this ſupereminent fruit of faith, <hi>(Even now when we ſee not)</hi> that <hi>believing, ye yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious:</hi> On purpoſe, I ſay, to make way for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up their thoughts &amp; apprehenſions, how infinitely tranſcending that ſalvation of their ſouls muſt be, when <hi>Faith</hi> ending,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60376:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> they attain to <hi>Sight, to ſee</hi> him face to face, whom their ſouls have loved: It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly as if he had ſaid unto them, Oh! think with your ſelves, what Joy, what Glory that muſt needs be, which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſurpaſſeth this that now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies your faith, in an anſwerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as much as <hi>ſight</hi> of Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and face to face, muſt be ſuppoſed to excel the knowledge of him by faith, which ſees him but as abſent, darkly!</p>
                  <p>And further, give me leave to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Notion: You may take this aſſured evidence, That your ſouls ſhall then ſee, and enjoy God, when your faith ſhall <hi>CEASE,</hi> which will be, when once your ſouls ſhall come to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from your bodies by death: In that, even now, in this life, it is your Souls and Spirits that are the immediate recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or partakers and ſubjects of ſuch glorious Joys,</p>
                  <p>The ſoul enjoys them (though in the body, yet) without the help or concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the body, or the phantaſms of it: yea, ſuch Raptures do <hi>paſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> that is, the common way of underſtanding, which by the uſe and help of the body, or images in the fancy, the Mind exerciſeth in other things, and which do concur with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60376:160"/> ordinarily in <hi>faith.</hi> But this joy falls into, and is illapſed within the ſoul it ſelf immediately; yea, the weakneſs of your bodies, and bodily ſpirits, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to have ſo much of this joy, as otherwiſe the ſoul is now capable of by faith. And therefore by this experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal taſte aforehand in your own ſouls, you may be aſcertained, That your ſouls, when ſeparate from your bodies by death, as well as when united again unto their bodies, ſhall enjoy this <hi>great Salvation.</hi>

                  <p>But lo! a greater matter is here.

                  <p>When God's ordinary Works are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, it ſufficeth himſelf to ſay, God did thus, or this: But when God's <hi>Works of Wonder,</hi> then often you find ſuch an illuſtrious Note of Reflection upon, and pointing at Him, to have done as God.

And in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency unto this, God is ſtiled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>The Father of our Spirits,</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the Fathers of our Fleſh or Bodies; (ſee the words:) Which Alliance or Fatherhood, take it as in common with all Mens Spirits, lieth in this, That he not only created our Souls immediately out of nothing, but in his own Image, as to the ſubſtance of them,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60376:163"/> which Image or Likeneſs other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did not bear, which yet were made out of nothing, as the <hi>Chaos</hi> was; both which appear, by putting two places together, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>He frameth their Spirits</hi> (ſpeaking of the Souls of Men) and that, <hi>[altogether]</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 15. (ſo <hi>Ainſworth;</hi> and others read it) that is, both, each of thoſe Spirits; and alſo wholly and total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every whit of the ſubſtance of them: <hi>Creatio eſt productio totius entis;</hi> for Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation differs from Generation in this, that it is a <hi>raiſing up or producing the whole of a being out of meer nothing,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>[altogether,]</hi> whereas Generation preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth pre-exiſtent matter; as in the generation of our Bodies, which are not wholly and every whit of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but the Parents afford the matter, and the formative virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by which our Bodies are framed. So then, in reſpect of our firſt Creation, our Souls (apart conſidered) are thus allied to God, to which our Bodies are not; being Spirits in the very Being of them, that altogether do owe that their Being to him.</p>
                  <p>But there is a taint come upon the Souls of all Men by Sin, ſo as this alliance is thereby worn out, yea forfeited, until
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60376:164"/> it be reſtored. Now therefore theſe Souls (the only ſubject of our Diſcourſe) being ſuch as God hath wrought, and ſo are become his Workmanſhip by a new and far nobler Creation, and thereby cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Spirit anew, according to what Chriſt ſays, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> Hereupon theſe Souls are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon a double account: as you ſay of Sugar, it is double-refined; ſo this is now become a ſpiritual Spirit, or Spirit ſpiritualized and ſublimated; yea, and thereby the inward Sanctuary, <hi>the Holy</hi>

                  <p>And hereupon that original Affinity to God of Spirit, is not only reſtored, but endeared; for now there is both the ſtuff, or the ground-work, and then the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, or embroidery upon it, and both of them the Works of God; that ſo look as the Gold wrought upon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Enamel, and then again the Enamel enhaunceth the value of the Gold, ſo as both are conſidered in the price; ſo it's here with this Soul wrought by God in both reſpects.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It fails of all ſorts of Comforts it had in and by its union with the Body in this World, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. <hi>When you fail,</hi> ſays Chriſt, ſpeaking of Death, 'tis your City-phraſe when any of you break, and perhaps are thereby driven into another Kingdom, as the Soul now is.</p>

                  <p>This is a ſpecial ſeaſon for God to ſhew his Love to ſuch a Soul, if ever afore or after, an opportunity, ſuch as falls not out, neither afore, whilſt it was in the Body; nor after, when it is united to the Body again, at the Reſurrection: if ever therefore he means to ſhew a reſpect unto a poor Soul, which is his ſo neer Kindred and Alliance, it muſt be done now. We read in Pſal. 73. 26. <hi>My Fleſh and my Heart faileth</hi> (as at Death to be ſure it doth) <hi>but God is the ſtrength of my Heart,</hi> both in this Life and at Death to ſupport me <hi>[and my portion for ever]</hi> in the Life to come without any interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or vacant ſpace of time, as that <hi>[ever]</hi> imports: and that <hi>David</hi> ſpake this with an Eye unto the Glory to come, when Heart, and Fleſh, and all in this World he foreſaw would fail him, is evident by what he had immediately meditated in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60376:165"/> the words afore, ver. 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel,</hi> ſo in this Life, and afterwards (that being ended) ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me unto Glory.

Now doth God thus profeſs to have a regard to them in this Life, and that upon this account, that they are Spirits, leſt they ſhould fail, or faint; and ſhall we not think that when indeed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they do fail (as after Death you have heard (even now) Chriſt himſelf expreſſeth they would) and would upon all theſe conſiderations before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſink into utter deſolation, unleſs they were <hi>received into everlaſting Habitations</hi> (as Chriſt there alſo ſpeaks) Do we think that God will not now entertain them?

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. God profeſſeth himſelf <hi>the Father of Spirits;</hi> which relation, though it ſpeaks his being the <hi>Creatour</hi> of them, at the firſt, yet hath ſomething more of <hi>bowels</hi>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:60376:168"/> in it: it ſayes withal ſomething further, when it falls out that ſuch <hi>Spirits,</hi> as he is a Father unto by the firſt creation, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>ſubjects of His eternal Love,</hi> by Grace and Election unto the <hi>Adoption of Children,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. ſee the words.

And this is equitable upon a very great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for his relation of <hi>Father</hi> is more eminent to his Grace by Election, and then again by the grace of his ſecond Creation, than it could be any way ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be by the <hi>firſt</hi> Creation. And therefore is ſet and pitcht in like ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and eminency upon the ſame object,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60376:169"/> that is, their Spirits. And hence it may well, yea muſt be ſuppoſed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That if God did make ſuch a <hi>Darling</hi> of the Soul, ſuch an account of it by creation, as to entitle himſelf ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>the Father thereof,</hi> then certainly this love of <hi>Grace</hi> much more hath in like equipage taken up the ſame gracious <hi>ſpecial relation</hi> in its kind of <hi>Father</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: not only becauſe Nature ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be found to exceed Grace in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; but that indeed the motives are far greater, that God ſhould extend the like and greater priviledges where he meant to love by <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Choice,</hi> than he did where he loved only by a <hi>due</hi> and meet <hi>Law of Creation:</hi> So that when God ſhall profeſs himſelf a <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>their Spirits,</hi> ſpeaking to ſuch as are his Elect, he ſtrongly inſinuateth thereby, That he is by Grace likewiſe the <hi>Father of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> in a peculiar manner. And truly that ſpeech of our Saviour at his death confirms it, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commit my Spirit:</hi> It was not barely as a <hi>Father</hi> of his Spirit by creation (as you all know) but by everlaſting Love, and ſo in that reſpect alſo in a peculiar manner the <hi>Father of his Spirit;</hi> and therefore as to a <hi>Father</hi> he commends his <hi>ſeparate</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto him. And this he did, although
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60376:169"/> he was to riſe again in leſs than three whole dayes ſpace.</p>
                  <p>Now we read <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. the Apoſtle to hold forth this very relation of God's being <hi>a Father of Spirits,</hi> with this promiſe thereunto annexed, <hi>That they ſhould live:</hi> which relation of <hi>Father,</hi> &amp;c. although it be there explicitely ſpoken in reſpect of their firſt Creation (which is common unto the Saints with others) yet being uttered of and unto Men in the ſtate of Grace (as thoſe were ſuppoſed whom he there exhorteth, and that to move them to be ſubject unto him as ſuch, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they ſhould live) it evidently reſpecteth not meerly the relation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of what was paſt the act of creating them, but it looketh to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That they depended upon him (as Children do upon Fathers for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture livelihood, ſo theſe) for to live in him and with him as a Father to their Spirits by Grace. For I take hold of that Word <hi>[and live];</hi> this Life is well inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>They ſhall ſee God,</hi> that is, be glorified, and ſo I conclude all thus, That if he would have them be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in holineſs, as upon that relation, as unto <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That they ſhould live;</hi> then ſurely one ſpecial aim of the Promiſe is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60376:170"/> and hath this Eye, That God as a <hi>Father of their Spirits</hi> will therefore take care of their Spirits ſingly, and ſo when ſeparate, that they ſhall live. And that accordingly he will give demonſtration of this ſpecial relation born to their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (when the occaſion ſhall be) conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red apart in beſtowing this Life on them: and truly when is it more proper for him to ſhew himſelf as a Father, than when their Souls after their ſubjection to him in Holineſs here accompliſhed; and when that, as naked Spirits they come to ſtand in need, and ſtand afore him in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, being now turned out of houſe and home, and quite caſhered out of this World, and come ſtript and naked of all but Holineſs unto their Father (for it is ſaid, <hi>They return to God that gave them)</hi> who proves to be their Father by Grace. And doubt not of it but he will certainly then own them, and give them a Father's Bleſſing, and not reject them as if they were but Baſtards and no Children (as that Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks) but as Spirits, who as Sons have ſerved him, and been ſubject to him.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, Fourthly, God his being our God, which is more home to the Demonſtration of this Point than all the former. The Text ſays, <hi>He that wrought</hi>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:60376:170"/> 
                     <hi>us for this, is God.</hi> I add, he is your God. And this alone, if we will take the Scriptures verdict, will carry it, and loe, as he is ſtyled <hi>The Father of Spirits</hi> in common, and yet withal <hi>a Father of their Spirits,</hi> out of ſpecial Love: So in like manner, he is ſtyled both <hi>The God of the Spirits of all Fleſh,</hi> (that is, of Man, <note place="margin">Numb. 16. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 12. 20.) thus in common; and alſo to his Elect, <hi>I am your God by Grace.</hi> And theſe two Relations, God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are commenſurate, and exactly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, whether they be applied unto all Men in common, or to the Elect in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he is termed, <hi>The God of the Spirits,</hi> and likewiſe, <hi>The Father of the Spirits of all Men:</hi> So in common, anſwerably he is your God, and your Father, by ſpecial Grace to his Elect; both which in this latter reſpect you find yoked hand in hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 17. Look how far he is a God of the one, ſo far a Father alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth in the other: And look how far that he is our God, ſo far reacheth alſo that he is our Father. If therefore the <hi>God of our Spirits,</hi> to provide for them becauſe he is our God, then anſwerably the <hi>Father of our Spirits</hi> in the like pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarneſs, becauſe our Father. And ſo the proof of this fourth Particular, will add further ſtrength and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60376:171"/> to that we preſented in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>Now that his being our God (which is the ſubſtance of the Covenant of Grace) doth engage him to provide Glory for ſeparate Souls, That one inſtance of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (The Father of the faithful,</hi> and we all his Sons perſonated in him) is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evidence, God did profeſs himſelf <hi>The God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> and unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15. 1. perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>I am thy abundant Reward,</hi> (which reſpected the Life to come) and his <hi>Friend,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 7.</p>
                  <p>Now the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do improve this relation of God's unto us, unto two Inferences drawn from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Inſtance: whereof the one is the point afore us.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is Chriſt's Inference from thence, That therefore <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Soul lives, and <hi>Abraham</hi> both <hi>Soul and Body ſhall riſe again, for God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> Matth. 22. 31. Thus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Collection from the ſame Promiſe, is, That God had provided in the mean time for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Soul <hi>afore the Reſurrection,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> and an <hi>Houſe</hi> therein <hi>for him.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>But now they deſire a better Country, that is, an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:60376:171"/> 
                     <hi>wherefore God is not aſhamed to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their God, for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi> To give light to this, <hi>Paul</hi> had repreſented the Story and Caſe of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the reſt of the Patriarchs, in the verſes afore, to have been this; That God had indeed promiſed the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to him and them, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. it is ſaid, That theſe <hi>all died in Faith, not having received the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, being Strangers in the Land;</hi> yea, not <hi>having a foot of Land</hi> in the Land of Promiſe, as <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 5, 6, 7. And alſo <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>9th</hi> verſe of this <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Now then, when they died, what was it their Faith expected in ſtead thereof? The <hi>10th</hi> verſe tells us, <hi>He looked for a City whoſe Maker and Builder is God.</hi> From which compared, obſerve, That when he died, his Faith was thus pitch'd to look for this City, in ſtead of that Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> promiſed. This was the expectation of their Faith on their part. Well, but how doth it appear, that this flow'd from God's having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelf to be <hi>the God of Abraham, &amp;c. his Reward, and his Friend?</hi> You have this clear in the <hi>16th</hi> verſe, where you have the whole ſumm'd up as the Concluſion of the Story, and as the proof and ground hereof; but now <hi>they deſire</hi>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:60376:172"/> 
                     <hi>a better Countrey, that is, an heavenly:</hi> there is their faith and expectation when they ſhould come to die. Then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City;</hi> which ſpoken in full anſwer to that their expectation at their deaths, to ſhew, that God in profeſſing himſelf <hi>to be their God,</hi> he had thereby engaged himſelf according to his own intent in that promiſe, to make this proviſion for them at their death: The words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, <hi>Wherefore God is not aſhamed;</hi> what ſhould this mean in this Coherence, but that his declaring himſelf to be <hi>their God,</hi> did import and carry this with it, That he had provided this <hi>Eſtate</hi> for them at their death, even <hi>an heavenly;</hi> and, that otherwiſe (as the Apoſtle gloſſeth upon it) he had not come up unto the amplitude of, nor filled full this covenanted Engagement and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>His being their God.</hi> Will you have it in <hi>plain Engliſh</hi> (as we ſpeak;) if he had not made this proviſion for their Souls, he would have been <hi>aſhamed</hi> to have been called <hi>their God:</hi> thus deeply doth this oblige him, That he is our God and Father, which is the point in hand.</p>
                  <p>And judge of this in the light of all that Reaſon we have hitherto carried along;
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:60376:172"/> and again, let this inference of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mutually ſerve to confirm us in all <hi>that Reaſon.</hi> For poor <hi>Abraham</hi> to be driven out of his own Country by God, who <hi>called him to his foot,</hi> and ſaid no more, but as a Maſter to his Servant, Take your Cloke, and follow me (who muſt preſently, without more ado, trig and foot it after his Maſter) as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 2. and then to live a <hi>ſtranger</hi> in the <hi>Land of Promiſe,</hi> upon the faith, that God would be <hi>his God:</hi> which faith in him, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ceaſe when he came to die. If this God in this caſe ſhould not have taken care to anſwer his faith in ſome greater way, in ſtead of the poſſeſſion of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and that after, upon his being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of that Country too, which he ſojourned in during this life, if God had not provided another Houſe, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or City for his Soul, that was to live, to bring it into, when it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all in this World; The Apoſtle tell us, <hi>God</hi> (in this caſe) <hi>would have been aſhamed</hi> to have been called <hi>his God:</hi> which now, having provided ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for him upon dying, there is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant cauſe to ſay, <hi>God is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed;</hi> for that is a <hi>diminutive</hi> imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he infinitely exceedeth that their expectation could be ſuppoſed to be.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:60376:173"/>
                  <p> Let us but view the force of this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Apoſtle's (and ſo of all the reaſonings hitherto read) But according to man, or what is found amongſt men, (and God will be ſure infinitely to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs men in <hi>his</hi> ways of favour.) Take an ordinary friend, if his freind be turn'd out of houſe and home, plundred, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, driven out of all, as the <hi>Steward</hi> in that parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. was, and comes to his <hi>Friend at midnight,</hi> as in that other Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 5, 6. will not his friends entertain him into their houſes; as <hi>ver.</hi> 9, of <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. yea, and riſe at midnight to do it, as <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. in that Parable of <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. Shall profeſſion of friendſhip en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage and oblige men to do this, and ſhall not God's profeſſing himſelf to be <hi>our God, Father, Friend,</hi> engage his heart much more? Nay, will he not ſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, as ſhall exceed all wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? What need I ſay more than this? Wherefore <hi>He is not aſhamed to be called their God:</hi> He will therefore give you an entertainment that ſhall be worthy of his being your God.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and laſt Conſideration is, That theſe ſeparate Souls having done and finiſh'd all their work, that in order to Glory God hath appointed them for ever to do, they now at death appear
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60376:173"/> afore him as a <hi>Judge and Rewarder.</hi> And that is the fifth <hi>Relation</hi> moving God to beſtow at this ſeaſon ſuch a Glory on them. How that then the Soul <hi>returns to God,</hi> you have heard again and again out of <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. and that it is upon the account of his being the <hi>Judge</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at the end of their work in this life. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe hath long ſince gloſſed upon it, <hi>It returns to God, that it may ſtand in Judgment afore him.</hi> In this life it came unto God by Faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>believing that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>ſeek him;</hi> and now at the end of its Faith, it comes unto God for the <hi>Reward</hi> of its Faith, as ſome interpret that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. (which we ſo largely have inſiſted on.) This is certain, That in that Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be <hi>his God,</hi> he intended and included, his being to him <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Reward.</hi> And ſo we come to connect this fifth Head with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going. <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 1.</note> And therefore if the <hi>being his God,</hi> moved him to <hi>prepare that City againſt his death</hi> (as hath been ſaid;) then ſurely his being <hi>his Reward,</hi> doth alſo then take place. I ſhall not omit it, becauſe it falls in the next Chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. that in <hi>that</hi> ſtupendious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Heaven, God <hi>the Judge</hi> of all is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60376:174"/> mentioned between <hi>the Church of the firſt-born which are written in Heaven;</hi> this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>and the Spirits of juſtified Men made perfect;</hi> this after it: For there are none of theſe <hi>Firſt-born,</hi> or <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men,</hi> do come to ſit down there, but they paſs the award of this <hi>Judge</hi> firſt, for they ſit down by him; and ſurely, having done all their Work in the time of <hi>that day</hi> is allotted to each man to work in, it is a <hi>righteous thing with God</hi> to give them a <hi>Reward</hi> in the evening of this day, (which is Chriſt's time ſet for rewarding, and it is the twelfth and laſt hour ſucceeding the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh of the day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <note place="margin">See <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis, Maldonat. &amp;c.</hi> Lev. 19. 13.</note> compared) which is when the night of death comes. Now there is a Law given by God, that the wages to a man hired ſhould be given him (by him that ſet him awork) in <hi>his day,</hi> that is, ſays the Septuagint, the <hi>very ſame day,</hi> ſo as his <hi>Work,</hi> or the wages of his Work, <hi>abide not with thee all the night until the morning,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 24. 15.</note> ſays God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 15. Did God take care for hirelings, when their Work was done not to ſtay any ſpace of time, no not a night, and doth he not fulfil this himſelf unto his Sons that ſerve him? Surely yes: he defers not, nor puts them off to the <hi>morning</hi> of the Reſurrection, as
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60376:174"/> the Pſalmiſt elegantly calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. laſt. It <hi>abides not with him</hi> all that dark and <hi>longſome</hi> night, or ſpace after death, in which their bodies reſt in the grave, which is termed <hi>Man's long home:</hi> and, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The days of darkneſs are many</hi> (ſays <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)</hi> No, he rewards them in the <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the day,</hi> beſides what he will add to it in the morning. It is obſervable, that <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 9, 10. concerning the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Souls ſlain for Chriſt, that whilſt they cry for Juſtice on their enemies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them that were ſlain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony which they held, and they cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, doſt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> that they had white robes given them to quiet them in the mean time; <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>And white Robes were given unto every one of them, and it was ſaid unto them, that they ſhould reſt yet for a little ſeaſon;</hi> till they heard that vengeance alſo was executed on that Roman Empire for their blood ſhed. And thus to deal is a righteous thing with God.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have ſeen the Point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from all ſorts of relations that God bears unto us, by congruous Reaſons,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60376:175"/> that ſo it becometh God, the great God to do<hi>—He that hath wrought us for this thing, is God.</hi> And ſo much for this <hi>firſt Branch</hi> of this <hi>ſecond Doctrine.</hi>

It is ſaid by <hi>David</hi> of himſelf (and it is true of all men in their meaſure) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 15. <hi>I was made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the Earth;</hi> that is, in my Mother's Womb, as the context ſhews; which are termed the <hi>Lower parts of the Earth,</hi> as when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. to have <hi>deſcended into the lower part of the Earth;</hi> that is, to be conceived in the Womb of a Virgin; when a Child is born, a lump of fleſh, animated with a Soul, comes forth, <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought,</hi> &amp;c. but wrought, for what? in <hi>David's</hi> perſon (in which this was ſpoken) it was for a Kingdom, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt condition of enjoyments in this World. But in every other man (that is born) it is that he was curiouſly wrought, in a fitneſs and capacity to all things that are in this World, <hi>made</hi> and prepared exactly for it long afore it came into the World; you may ſee it in <hi>Adam</hi> (our firſt pattern) more lively. God
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60376:178"/> was buſie for ſix dayes in making this World, the Angels all that while ſtood wondring with themſelves, to what end, or for whom all this was prepared. At <note place="margin">Job. 36. 7.</note> the end of the ſixth day, they ſaw God to ſet down into the World this little thing called <hi>Man;</hi> and then they ceaſed their wonderment, for they ſaw all this World (prepared aforehand) ſet in Man's heart, and all in Man curiouſly wrought and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all things made in in this World, <hi>richly to enjoy,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. We may apply that in the text, to this, it appeared, <hi>That he that hath made Man for this ſelf-ſame thing is God;</hi> both works of wonder apart, and yet as fitted to each other: All wonderment exceeding—. I might much more enlarge upon the ſuiting of <hi>Chriſt the Head and Husband,</hi> and the Church his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> wrought and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to him in all ages, both apart, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and hiddenly prepared, and each ſo glorious in themſelves, and yet put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Let us defer our Admiration hereat until the latter day. Juſt thus it is in fitting the Soul for that glory: and again, that glory in Heaven for that Soul: God works the one for the other apart.—The very ſimilitude in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſes do import ſo much; He ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Glory in Heaven a being <hi>clothed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:60376:178"/> and Holineſs here he compares to an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-garment,</hi> which that of Glory is to be put over, or upon: There was never a curious Artiſt in making Garments that ever took meaſure of the proportions of an <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>under</hi> Garment, to fit the one to the other, as God hath in proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his work upon us here, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Glory for each of us in the World to come: He hath took exact meaſure, and his Law is (that deſigned his own workings on both hands afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand) that <hi>every man ſhall receive his own reward according to his own labour,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>Now the Artifice of God in both theſe lies in this, That each are hiddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived apart, and yet ſo gloriouſly matcht as wrought one for the other; which is an argument as of two Artificers, the one in the Eaſt-Indies, the other in the Weſt; ſhould the one make the <hi>Caſe,</hi> the other make the <hi>Watch,</hi> unbeknown each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and both Workmanſhips of the higheſt curioſity in their kind, and when both brought together they exquiſitely fit the one the other.</p>

                     <p>But you will ask me, How I fetch this out of my Text? Thus:</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. It is another Rule, that in any Scripture where <hi>Two Perſons</hi> are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as concurring in any thing, or matter; There the other Third Perſon alſo muſt be underſtood to have his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſhare therein alſo; as when he wiſheth <hi>Grace and Peace from God the Father, and from Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> 'Tis certain the holy Ghoſt is as ſpecially underſtood; as indeed we find him in that Apoſtolical Bleſſing as diſtinctly ſpoken of, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Chriſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>But 3.
